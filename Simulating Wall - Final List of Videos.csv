Like women getting kidnapped, thrown into cars, and smuggled across unwalled sections of the border. He told one such harrowing tale on live TV in the Rose Garden on January 25. He was announcing a temporary end to the government shutdown, but the assembled reporters were also treated to a minute-long yarn about kidnapped migrants. Scary stuff (if unsubstantiated). So in the spirit of fact-checking, VICE News’ Alzo Slade went to the bootheel of New Mexico, an area that's seen an increase in Central American migrants seeking asylum in recent months, to hear if its residents had seen anything resembling Trump’s claims. Spoiler alert: They hadn’t. But just to be thorough, Alzo pitched a tent along an unwalled section of the border separating the U.S. from Mexico to see if he could catch those “criminal cartels, narco-terrorists, transnational gangs like MS-13 and human traffickers” the president says are pouring over the unwalled border before “they make a left or a right into the United States of America.” What Alzo saw won’t surprise you either.

The U.S. also closed one of two pedestrian crossings at the San Ysidro crossing in a move apparently aimed at preventing any mass rush of migrants across the border. The installation of movable, wire-topped barriers threatens to complicate life for Mexicans using San Ysidro, where about 110,000 people enter the U.S. every day in 40,000 vehicles. Long lines backed up in Tijuana, where many people have to cross the border to work on the U.S. side. Such inconveniences prompted by the arrival of the migrant caravan may have played a role in Sunday's protests, when about 400 Tijuana residents waved Mexican flags, sang the Mexican national anthem and chanted ""Out!

,,,15,VICE News,QeZnN_EjYyo,,2018-11-01 15:58:17,Trump’s Troop Surge On The Mexican Border Is Unprecedented (HBO),"President Trump announced late on Wednesday that his military surge along the border with Mexico could eventually see 15,000 troops deployed, three times the number previously been reported. If he follows through on that promise, iIt would be the largest domestic deployment of active duty military in modern American history, and eclipse the number of troops currently stationed in Iraq. And it raises major questions about how that many active soldiers and Marines could possibly be used. In simple terms, the scale and nature of Trump’s deployment along the southern border is unprecedented, but history offers a few hints at what might come next. Presidents have deployed the military along the border a number of times in the past, but they’ve almost always used the National Guard In 2010, Barack Obama sent 1,200 National Guardsmen to the border for 15 months, as part of a mission he called Operation Phalanx. It cost roughly $160 million. But the most comparable example can likely be found under George W. Bush, who in 2006, sent some 6,000 Guardsmen to the border for a two year period starting in 2006, a cost to taxpayers of $1.2 billion. Once down there, the troops largely worked behind the scenes. “They were not patrolling the border,” said Adam Isacson, the director of the defense oversight program at the nonprofit Washington Office on Latin America, “They were monitoring the sensors, they'd be doing oil changes for the Border Patrol vehicles and maintaining equipment. And just a lot more of them also were sitting under tents in lawn chairs with binoculars looking at the border looking for anyone suspected of the crossing.” Still, those jobs were not entirely inconsequential. Michael Fisher, who was Chief of the Border Patrol from 2010 to 2015, said that during his time in office, Guardsmen mostly focused on tasks that allowed Border Patrol agents to better do their own jobs, including surveillance and intelligence gathering missions. “That would free up Border Patrol agents who in the absence of the military would be doing those types of missions,” Fisher said.

They’re part of the more than 5,000 troops Donald Trump deployed to the US-Mexico border ahead of the midterm elections, at an estimated cost of $200 million. Most of the troop in the Rio Grande Valley are now living on Base Camp Donna, ten miles east of McAllen. In the last week, army engineers have built the camp up to accommodate a long-term deployment: it now has hot showers, laundry facilities, and a kitchen to produce two hot meals a day. Many of the soldiers there have served in Afghanistan and Iraq, and life on Base Camp Donna is much like life on any other base — except here, there’s no enemy to fight, and the troops have almost nothing to do. The migrant caravan they're supposed to be responding to is weeks away and headed to Tijuana, 1,500 miles to the West. The only concrete missions the troops have engaged in so far consist of “hardening” parts of the border with concertina wire. When that’s done, said Major Derek Wamsley, a public affairs officer at the base, “we move back here and wait for the next request from Customs and Border Protection.” Subscribe to VICE News here: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE-News Check out VICE News for more: http://vicenews.com Follow VICE News here: Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/vicenews Twitter: https://twitter.com/vicenews Tumblr: http://vicenews.tumblr.com/ Instagram: http://instagram.com/vicenews More videos from the VICE network: https://www.fb.com/vicevideo",25,News & Politics,PT3M35S,215,2d,hd,FALSE,1,924467,10927,4267,0,7801,TRUE

Glenn Spencer has transformed his 104-acre ranch on the Arizona-Mexico border into a high tech fortress to stop any drug smugglers or illegal immigrants in their tracks. The retiree is determined to""keep America's borders safe"" and in doing so has developed a state-of-the-art security and monitoring system that can spot smugglers and human traffickers. His patented seismic sensor and drone technology has been presented to US Homeland Security, with a view to them using the system across American borders. He was spurred into action after a terrified neighbour told him she was moving home after witnessing rival Mexican drug cartel members shoot out in her ranch. Glenn, the president of the non-profit American Border Patrol, claims he has reduced illegal activity in the same area by more than 95 percent in 15 years. He told Sun Online: ""I came out here to solve the border problem and my hope is that this technology can be used to protect America's borders here on the southern border. ""Even as we speak there are drug traffickers, human traffickers, cartels are out there illegally entering this country. ""The Border Patrol can't keep up with the amount of illegal activity happening here. ""I guarantee that if you install this - we will stop drug smuggling cold within six months. ""I could tell the President: 'You install this technology on the border - I will show you high definition video of anybody who gets close within two minutes'. ""Within two minutes he can be sitting in the situation room in the White House and see people crossing over the border in California, Arizona - everywhere.” Sun Online was granted access to the cutting-edge ranch - where secret underground sensors can detect people and light aircraft within a 600-foot range and monitor their movements from the air. When anyone attempts to walk over the hidden sensors - and alarm is triggered in Glenn's control centre, deploying a drone which tracks suspects' every move. The system - based on technology he used during his time in the oil industry - could eradicate all illegal activity on the border within months, Glenn claims. He says the technology has helped apprehend hundreds of suspected illegal immigrants and traffickers. In one clip of dramatic footage collected by Glenn, around half a dozen people are caught crossing the border during the night, wearing backpacks, which he suspects are full of drugs. Glenn has even spent upwards of £150,000 to test his equipment in areas off his ranch - on a known drug-trafficking corridor - and caught a group of suspects on the first day. But his actions have not been popular with some… Continue reading: https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/7522086/meet-the-81-year-old-american-border-defender-who-is-waging-a-one-man-war-against-illegal-immigrants-and-drug-smugglers-on-the-mexican-border-with-cutting-edge-technology/ Sun Subscribers get the latest breaking news and videos directly to their feed.

Dozens of Mexican police with plastic riot shields stopped the migrants well ahead of the crossing, as US agents fired tear gas. Our chief correspondent Stuart Ramsay and his team have been on the front line of the migrants' struggle to make it across. Here's his latest report from the city of Tijuana.

But that isn’t true. In the summer of 2014, when record numbers of Central American children and families were apprehended at the U.S.-Mexico border, the Obama administration pressured Mexico to stop the migrant flow closer to the source: At its own southern border with Guatemala. Mexico readily complied, deploying unprecedented numbers of immigration agents, police, and military to shut down migrant routes, primarily in the southernmost state of Chiapas. By some measures, the so-called Southern Border Program was successful: In its first two years, immigration arrests in Mexico shot up by 85 percent, according to an analysis by the Washington Office on Latin America. But four years later, it’s clear that the Southern Border Program has created more problems than it’s solved. The migrant crisis is far from over, and will continue as long as intense violence, poverty, and political instability push Central Americans to flee their home countries. Instead, the crackdown has pushed migrants onto more remote and dangerous routes, where they’re vulnerable to predatory criminals who rob them — or much worse. ​Those migrants who are apprehended often wind up stuck for months in southern Mexico while they await for their cases to be processed. Many apply for asylum in Mexico, but even they, in many cases, want papers only so they can continue their journeys north undisturbed.

It encompasses an area bisected by the New River, where smugglers are known to guide people through polluted waters. The project, which includes a bridge over the river, is expected to take 300 days. More South Texas land owners getting letters on border wall Rio Grande City School District board president Daniel Garcia said the district got a letter in May about district property that’s being considered for “tactical infrastructure, such as a border wall.” The school board last month approved a request from U.S. Customs and Border Protection to come onto district property for survey and site assessment. The land is not currently being used by the district. Garcia said had he known it was meant for the border wall, he would have voted against the request. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Do you suffer from Trump Derangement Syndrome?

Sorry. We still have plenty of illegals to ship out. Get rid of those first, then we can talk about other things.
Don‚Äôt let them in. They are not even in and have started the violence already (@ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNWic0kGH-E&amp;t=3m28s">3:28</a>) hitting the border police with a 2X4 smh
Go back home. Fight to make your country better.
If they want a better future give us their women and we will breed them in trap houses and put them to work
They just want to start trouble not interested in bettering their lives.
INVADERS refused Mexican asylum, refused Mexican jobs, refused Mexican food ... INVADERS are thirsty to RAPE and PILLAGE the USA and control the drug trade in America!!!!
They all have new clothes and shoes. There is something wrong with this whole picture. They have supposedly walked hundreds of miles. Shoes and clothes would be in tatters. Yet all I see is well fed freshly clothed individuals.
I don&#39;t get it, once they get in the u.s. , what are they going to do and where are they going to stay or sleep
IF TRUMP CRASH LANDS IN AIRFORCE ONE IN MEXICO: <a href="https://youtu.be/PYYZFcvQfRg">https://youtu.be/PYYZFcvQfRg</a>
We just need their women
More than 500 you liars.
To bad the migrants didnt bring money to bribe the police
We love to ignore reality but we cant ignore the consequences of ignoring reality. You dont think this is ALL engineered to produce this exact reaction? Wake up!
Where Is American infrastructure to deal with the humanitarian crisis. Trump has no allies because he put the middle finger up to all them. US had time to prepare. His answer is force. He has got to go!
Lock it up and throw away the key.
Truth comes out
Go Trump!
Shut it down!
let them in ..after that ..deported them peacefully ..example ..4x4 ...
They close the borders for people who want to enter Mexico. Meaning Americans are also be fenced in, and Mexicans going back to Mexico can&#39;t leave the US.... This sounds like east Germany all over again.
She said 500 while 5000 economic migrants are in Tijuana
Who is paying for all there cell phone Bill&#39;s. ?? They have better phones then me. How or who ??
So now we have a the confrontation that trump and his fans ere hoping for. I&#39;m sure they all including trump feel better now. If normal and human steps had been taken to address this issue we wouldn&#39;t see this upheaval. I guess this makes it alright to use our military. Better still this gives trump a talking point for a news cycle. I&#39;ve seen angrier folks at a hockey game.
But you clearly said only a few weeks ago that there was no caravan. Liars.
I feel sorry especially for the kids is so hard leave everything behind you ...imagine what you do if you are in this situation????
We&#39;re all waiting next for the massive human rights violation Trump wants to launch. Use the troops to massacre every one of them. This will put the US on the world stage like Germany during WWII. A country that murdered immigrants for wanting a better life. GOD BLESS AMERIKKKA.
The caravan took asylum in Mexico. All that remains is the INVADERS. They REFUSED ASYLUM. ....
Thank God Trump is president !!<br />And this is coming from a Hispanic,<br />Yes i said it i am Hispanic
Cockroaches !
You cannot fit the whole world into Europe and the US. We have to make their countries better. WATCH <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPjzfGChGlE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPjzfGChGlE</a>
San Diego needs to organize their militia, line up and open fire on those thugs! Problem solved!
So those are the doctors and engineers and pilots and teachers that will build &amp; help usa if they enter
Soon here will be like Germany after great invasion no more ,good pay jobs for no one unfortunately that&#39;s going to happen soon
Mexican nationalist don&#39;t want them in thier country either, they were fighting them to get them. out of thier country the last few days.
Where&#39;s th SNIPERS.
Let them come. <br />There are too many vacant land and houses in Detroit. They can build cars at $2/hour.
This is why we need a wall. This is madness
+Kdog it's a start and it needs to be finished. If not this country will be taken over by illegals.
the wall is what stopped them, well the start of trumps wall. stopped them.
why is th FAKE MEDIA AND DEMOCRATS COVERING FOR NON AMERICANS WHY DOES DEMOCRATS CARE MORE FOR ILLEGALS OVER AMERICANS.
These people are composed of criminals, smugglers, drug peddlers, and gangs these aren&#39;t people who are good for the economic growth of country. Throwing stones and shouting as if they own USA is a mere fact that this was invasion.
I have to admit...I&#39;m with Trump on this one.
BBC...HATED IN U.K.<br />for their lies and spin.<br />covering for criminal invasion in U.K.<br />THE BRITS...HATE BBC....!! LEFTVWING. BS. !!! LIKE CNN..
Why does this remind me of the Migrant that sought asylum through out Europe earlier this year...there&#39;s a pattern developing here..
DILLY DILLY IMAGRENT MOFOS

Good
History will judge the US for actions like this,sad day.
democratic history will be taught that this is mean and cruel, truth is this is what's needed if we want to maintain law and order in our country.
No they took off running for the Border they&#39;re just showing these little pictures why don&#39;t they show the real video about the American side had to spray pepper spray and gas because they were climbing over the fence why don&#39;t you show that straight b*<b>****</b>
I advise they stop, don&#39;t matter how many woman and children you idiots show, the military will open fire ,. With real bullets, you stupid idiots ,are the ones who will be responsible for any deaths, you fake news morons
If they put this effort and determination into making their own homes (and lives) better, would it have made a difference?
GO HOME !!!
Open fire
Keep it closed!
THIS IS CRAZY !!!
STOP CALLING IT A &quot;&quot;PROTEST&quot;&quot;<br /><br />STOP LYING...MSM...<br /><br />IT IS AND ATTACK ON OUR COUNTRY&#39;S BORDERS. ...BY CRIMINAL ALIENS..<br /><br />GO HOME BBC...!!<br /><br />YOUR OWN BRITS..!!<br />HATE YOUR LEFTY WING BIAS !!!<br /><br />BBC...COVERS UP...<br />FOR THE UK.

If any liberals assist or aid these invaders, the military should take them out!
So we let the East Indians come take our business ¬ß properties but don‚Äôt want ppl who just want better jibs &amp; living for their children !!
east Indians came in legally(not all but most).
American HOMLESS men first!!!!! these invaders go home!!!
This is an invasion

What a waste of time and money process the asylum applications ASAP and who is not eligible send them straight back, They are going to a port of entry as told and NO they don&#39;t have to accept asylum in Mexico as they have the same cartels gangs etc there, the money Trump has wasted could have been used to process quickly, open as many courts to hear there cases and boom deport immediately this is just grandstanding and costing a bloody fortune
Good! Protect the United States
Someone was watching the movie bien in war LA
Sik people comino in that carabanü§ßü§¨üñê
And CNN&#39;S Jim acasta told Trump this wasn&#39;t real, these people are Invaders! Once again Trump&#39;s right! Fake news CBS just as bad as CNN ! Gaslighting! Look it up.
CBS has to hire a BBC reporter for a US story? Really nickel and dime outfit since all the diddling by Rose&amp;60 minutes
We demand for u to let us break into your country I white devils
I hope they all stay in Hollywood and Belair
Looks like Israel
It is high time to close the border! ! These ARE NOT IMMIGRANTS. THIS IS INVASION OF OUR BORDER !!!!! Get it right , people! !
I&#39;m against trump usually, but hes handling this very well. Cheersüëç
what? why?
Wow everyone in the comments are incredibly ignorant. Unreal
ignorant about what? these are the people that don't want to come in the right way like every other immigrant that came in before them.. why should they get a pass?
TEAR GAS...AND<br />RUBBER BULLETS...<br />FOR NOW !!!!!
Hope our troop their don&#39;t have to use force why can&#39;t those migrants leave

Mexican authority not good
Who are these people to come to our border and act disrespectful and act like animals? Take it home
BEGGARS CANT BE CHOOSERS
Lmmfao! Give them all a happy meal and send them home !. Lomfao!
Shame Mexico&#39;s Government is corrupt and useless !!! They are the Cartels üò§
the UN has thier hands on the Mexican police as well.. you should've seen Spanish news footage, mexicos police were only. armed with thier hands..
Poor people.
if one tries to go across... open fire
Very Demanding Migrants. The Show is on Now‚ÄºÔ∏èWe have more than enough Illegals &amp; more than enough of our own poor people.
This caravan is full of senseless ppl
welcome migrants we need truck drivers at Swift transportation,we train you an house your family welcome migrants.
+Fasustina Smith ,we got them paid off, do you realize how huge Swift transportation is,huuuuge
SWIFT TRANSPORTATION. YOUR COMPANY IS REPORTED TO ICE OFFICIALS. ..NOW.!! SEE IF YOU CAN TRAIN THEM.
This is in invasion its time to lift arms, its time to go to war with liberals too!!
And who&#39;s supporting the Immigrant migration? The same people who are opposing it. Manufactured chaos.
Kinda funny how the mainstream news keeps showing women and children in their coverage. When in reality this &quot;caravan&quot; is 98% men. Don&#39;t let the fake news fool you! This is an invasion made up of a lot of OTM&#39;s. (other than mexicans) Stand up Americans! Or we won&#39;t have an America as we know it much longer. #3%
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNWic0kGH-E&amp;t=1m20s">1:20</a> that doesn‚Äôt make sense, it doesn‚Äôt matter if they are ‚Äúprotesting‚Äù/trying to get their asylum processed quicker. They could have taken asylum in Mexico they don‚Äôt have to wait at all. This guy is giving them excuses. If you protest anything by acting like your about to rush a border your trying to rush the border period.
This is going to end badly and there will be blood. The American people do not want globalism! Look at Europe! No one wants that here. And some of us will die fighting it if you try to force it upon us.<br /><br />We will not capitulate!!!
Hey everyone panic! It&#39;s unarmed men, women, and children rushing to fill out forms! Heartless cowards.
If what they want is asylum, but they reject the same when Mexico is offering it them, wft !!! . . . Donald Trump should reject all false claims from the caravan. Ship all caravans and their lies back to what ever the came from
These people have no right to our freedoms! Only us, the superior American race is privy to being able to mooch off our government!
We get to stop them now, this is an invasion, push them back to Mexico, we are not paying for these people. No way!!!!
Sr Trump .ayuda d√©jelos pasar por favor y mandarlos a su pa√≠s.el gobierno de M√©xico no hace nada .y ellos hacen lo que quieren .en Tijuana es un caos ya no vienen turistas y est√° afectando la econom√≠a de esta ciudad.son personas si educaci√≥n . calores ni cultura.gracias.
No more freeloaders . Trump 2020
This is war. They have declared war on USA with their invasion.
This is a disease
Finally!!!! Awesome!
Heaven has a Gate a Wall and Extreme Vetting. Amen
I&#39;ve been stuck between three borders - one at the Lebanon airport, one between Russia and Hungary, and one between Russian and China. Never was I just given free access to a country. They all wanted money - lots of money, and/or a visa. To expect a country to just &#39;take care of you&#39; just because is non-sensical. Believe me, if I tried to just climb the fences and rush in - I&#39;d most likely have been shot.
Borders broke africa don&#39;t let it break us too
Lotta trump kunts trolling today
gas the animals
CBS<br />You‚Äôre the enemy of ‚ÄúWe the people ‚Äú you cannot be trusted, you serve an evil master, looking forward to chapter 11 the chapter 7 for you satanists.
I‚Äôm a United States citizen stuck in Tijuana now
Wealthy people want them here for cheap labor (slavery) Libtards want them here because wealthy people want them here. Libtards are dumb
There goes the neighborhood
<b>They Tewk err Jerrbs</b>
&quot;We&#39;ve woken the hive!&quot;
wow what are thepeople who work on both sides of the border going to do tomorrow for work?
Setup the firing squads if they get too far!
They won&#39;t process them just deport them
Oh well, I guess they&#39;ll have to stay in beautiful Tijuana. I mean I rather be there, nice warm weather.
Just like cockroaches when you turn on the lights.
MAGA!
They were warned repeatedly not to do this to America
Good!!!
Mexican people dont want that guys
close the border for a few weeks for safety..................then let see whats mexico will do.....i bet the cartels are getting upset with there drug trade getting slowed down....?????
D- Fence !
Looks like a scene from World War Z.
Law vs Outlaws! USA will win
Your Network is so fake and not telling the whole truth about this. See the animalistic chaos for yourself and watch how these Migrants act like Zombies who wants to bulldoze into the US disregarding any rule of law! Here is the link: <a href="https://youtu.be/SBRqj9zYmsY">https://youtu.be/SBRqj9zYmsY</a>
DEPORT tRUMPturds.... welcome the IMMIGRANTS!
Any Democrat who is voted for this to happen to our country should be removed immediately they are traitors to our country
About time
The nerve of these people to wave the flags of the countries they&#39;re running from while trying to force their way into ours. No sympathy for these people.
An escallation of feeling waiting two days. Five more years to go. That border crossing is going to be permanently closed.
I say shoot them start shooting them now let the military just gun them!!down!!!you want to rush our borders and act like a terrorist you get to eat led motherfuckers!!
Border closed to gangs, drugs, cartel and noncitizens.
Woman &amp; children? 1000 miles away? Another lie from obozo!
What would Obama do give them pallets of money so glad Clinton is not our president
WELL. I CANT BLAME HIM.Trump was TEAM <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23PLAYnoGAMEs">#PLAYnoGAMEs</a> when it came to the borderhe kept sayin that months ago into the new year.. Yall thought he was playing.. Now those migrants are being boldly rude and disrespecting the border patrol agents by throwing stuff and yelling out obscenities. We don&#39;t need that type of garbage play in our country..
So this group, soon to be 10,000 is going to wait 5 years for their turn in line to be processed? No.
We all complain yet majority voted for democrats in the house who is know of dolling out our tax payers monies for their own interest and not for the american people.
These people have been fed a big pack of lies. It is a human tragedy - due to the deception of the organizers...who are just using them like pawns.
WAKE UP AMERICA! FAKE NEWS ISN&#39;T REPORTING THIS YET...1:38 PM PST DEMS SAID TRUMP WAS WASTING TAXPAYER MONEY! <a href="https://youtu.be/0ISSwFlxSTc">https://youtu.be/0ISSwFlxSTc</a> via @YouTube
It has been reported numerous times that the Caravan is 90% young men. So wouldn‚Äôt it be correct to call it an Army. So here we have an Army threatening to crash the border and illegally enter the US. The DIMMS want to hug the invaders and Trump wants to keep them out. The choice seems clear.
The invasores is coming from san Diego
I thought the caravan didn&#39;t exist ???ü§î
Wouldn&#39;t a true &quot;asylum seeker&quot; take any help asap? Why would they refuse food shelter jobs and healthcare in Mexico? Just think about that...
they all have cellphones, so i hope they‚Äôre reading and translating these comments...
Shameful lies you present C B/S
I hope president trump puts pressure on the Mexican government to deport all the immigrants
&quot;They want their voices to be heard&quot; no what they really want is to avoid the long legal process that everyone else has to go through because the know they won&#39;t qualify. Pretty much everyone who emigrates to the US is looking for a better life, but if you let all the world&#39;s poor and uneducated in no one gets that better life
Jamie Macdonald I don‚Äôt understand why people don‚Äôt understand this. They don‚Äôt want to file the paperwork they don‚Äôt want to pay the fees they don‚Äôt want to wait in line like everyone else.
If the US military sends our troops to other countrys to protect thier Borders then they need to send troops to protect our Borders.
Shoot them dead. Send the message back to anyone thinking about invading
Obviously we have South American migrants at the Mexico/California border. They climbing up the fences, claiming asylum, trying to get citizenship and free benefits...so y&#39;all need to protect yo borders, protect yo resources and protect yo constitution cuz they comin&#39; fo that too
You guys forgot to mention that even the Mexicans didn&#39;t want these people in their country it&#39;s not about racism it&#39;s about their country being invaded.. but even so Mexico did offer them asylum to whoever may ask and they rejected.. so by default these people will not get asylum will not get citizenship do not pass go do not collect $200
Random question - do roaches serve purpose? ü§î
Its time the mexico can help them get a working visa inside mexico too not just USA side
Invaders, not migrants. Close the border. Protect America.
this is a lie. Not 500, more like alomost all 5000
I don&#39;t get it why are people afraid of people they&#39;re never going to meet
+True Fiction again it just seems like fear Point and blame the other run the other that's fear
100101mint mint101001 lol that‚Äôs not even an issue. Try again
What are you guys really distracting us from?!
Just imagine what America would be like today if Native American had been able to do this when the white settlers started showing up in droves
thank you Second generation Cherokee family on 3 reservations not sure what the difference is
.
Being invaded sux lol
Clearance for use of lethal weapons granted
well there you have it cbs....you are selling a crock of bs...soon your globalist elite will topple , and none of you shills will have a job!
Sound&#39;s like Trump The chump had his hand in this..his parents and wife are immigrants also..Sad ain&#39;t it..
agree all are unless Native Americans
they were willing to force themselves into this country illegally so grant none of them assylum
I didn&#39;t vote for Trump and I can&#39;t say that on a personal level I approve of his behavior but what I will say is he is doing a lot of things that I approve of and I&#39;m man enough to admit that it seems like he&#39;s doing a good job perhaps I was wrong.
I fully support President Trump shut down the border until these illegal migrants go back home.
Proud Americans! Tell me what did you do be for you were born to be an American? Proud white folks! Tell me what you did to become white? Indeed you did nothing. But yet your so proud. For the record I&#39;m a white American. Proud Christians!! Tell me what the bible says on pride! You are wrong. Nothing wrong with vetting people! But something wrong with pride
Fuera de M√©xico invasores hondure√±os fuera
Trump says‚ÄùOnly Russian immigrants are welcome‚Äù
Shoot all the invader rats
I&#39;m getting very irritated by this caravan of immigrants
This is an invasion people time to protect America!
Time to close the border and build the wall.
Shut it all down
Good closed sealed
Great job President Trump. Finally putting the people of America over coporate America and political correctness. Let the Americans that feel that this is cruel go to the Mexican side and help them out in whatever way possible.
Shoot them all
Those ‚Äúwhite flags‚Äù didn‚Äôt last long did they?! ü§§ Maybe they should have tried waiving American flags instead and begging instead of demanding <br />Just a thought. It‚Äôs a no from USA but Mexico wants you....
There&#39;s u tubeers Americans canadiens living in Honduras. So yes they have food and every neighborhood is not bad..and they have ability to have three kids by 17 years old so etching unaffordable in usa

Close the border
We need some K-9 right there.

Democrats: Come on guys, the caravan isn&#39;t a threat to the United States! Just chill out! <br /><br />Me: TAKE A LOOK AT THIS AND STOP LYING YOU LEFTIST SCUMBAGS!
Stop them Please!!!!¬† Close all borders!!!!!!¬†¬† We have so many living in tent with no medical that need help.¬† We can&#39;t solve the worlds problems, when we can seem to help our own.
I would make a rule if I were Trump I would say if anybody is caught in the United States illegally then they are automatically disqualified and do not get a citizenship ever
If any American citizen was stupid enough to get themselves stuck on the other side they deserve it! <br />Stuck on stupid gets shut out!<br />Wise up everyone!
Those migrants come from Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador, why are they waving a Mexican flag?
Good, 1 to 30 male to female ratio. Keep the lies alive cbs
MEXICAN authorised didn&#39;t use any tear gas nor did use force against the migrants .
MASA MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN&quot;&quot;&quot;
They will all settle for half million dollars lawsuit due to tear gas barbed wire and delays moving to America and lost wages sitting in mexico
LOOKS LIKE THEY JUST OPENED IT
Welp... there goes the inflation in cocaine &amp; fentanyl prices!!!

Jesus Christ is the way, the truth, and the life!
It&#39;s time for a photo op for the fake news!
Why are other countries allowed to control and defend their borders but the USA are not?
Use an A-10 they will stop coming!
They look like cockroaches. WE DO NOT WANT YOU! Go back to your own country where your own relatives are. Don&#39;t need more welfare mothers and kids, either. Enough of them already.
PEACE <br />PEACEFULLY <br />ORDER
many waving cellphones‚Äî-<br />how do they afford them if they‚Äôre dirt poor and have no jobs?<br />furthermore, how do they keep them charged?<br />something doesn‚Äôt add up
Illegals have been coming to this country for years and years, particularly since the Clinton administration and his Mexican trade agreement which allowed many, many companies to hire illegals in factories, etc. They allowed them to work without license and permits formerly forced on other workers and then paying them substandard wages and sometimes not paying them at all. First hand knowledge of some who claim their sisters children in Mexico and get all their tax money back or do not pay IRS at all but this greed help many companies get rich and the flood gates were open. Many have learned how to beat the system, they get a lot of free everything and having many babies and now it has become apparent that they are draining the system, so I say America is having to pay for the sins of getting rich off people who will take over the country. It should have been required to speak English to get employed and not the other way around. So now deal with the Backlash of a Culture who feels they have built this country. Folks---Your hatred is loud and clear. LOL!!!
Hose them down with rubber bullets and bean bags
Just to think... alot of them haven&#39;t masturbated in months... I can&#39;t even go a day xD damn I think I am starting to accept my <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23AmericanPrivilege">#AmericanPrivilege</a> :D

Migrant = illegal
I‚Äôd pay money to be able to shoot them all
Wow, you're really just a great person huh?

they are like ants
<b>They need to go back home..</b>
Why doesn‚Äôt the USA just help them try to make their country great again and get rid of the gangs that control their country so then they won‚Äôt have any reason to come here in the first place.
My thoughts exactly
I agree.
How do these poor people with nothing get fed and have clean clothes and are carrying new smart phones that I can&#39;t afford. What a sham . . . . legal Immigrants must be really mad ! There will be a wall soon after this disgrace of people want everything given to them. Not on my tax dollars.
Good Job President Trump! ‚ÄúNO UN TROOPS ON USA SOIL!‚Äù<br />Close the Entire<br />Border! This has to STOP Mexico and the invaders are not taking us serious! Its the only way. Mexico created this and enabled them transporting them to our border- then Mexico lies about holding them!<br />God Bless President TRUMP and Protect our Troops, Law enforcement empowering them as they keep them all out!!!<br />God Bless America!üá∫üá∏üôèüèª
Illegal aliens have been doing this for decades, this ain&#39;t nothing new !!! My country is not going to take it anymore, this is the alien attack that we have always thought would happen but we expected creatures from a different planet !!!
+Denise Davis Millions have crossed the border illegally, not this many at once but millions !!!
Have they always come in, in such large nuumbers?
They should carpet bomb that caravan and use live rounds for up close and personal contact
fake news. but electric fences could work
No longer a migrant crisis <br />Now revealed a clear invasion to met with necessary force.
See, there disrespectful and violent! They can&#39;t even wait peacefully like everyone that&#39;s been there for months. They don&#39;t deserve to live in our country acting like that! They need to fix there own country.
What about the American citizens who are stuck there? Many live in Tijuana and work in San Diego...if you&#39;re not from this area and not aware of our economy..you have no basis for your comments
I hope there is some kind of chemical castration agent mixed in with that tear gas
they are receiving far better treatment than they deserve.<br />GOD BLESS AMERICA AND OUR MAGNIFICENT PRESIDENT
This isn&#39;t a government of the people anymore.
Mexicans mad at ILLEGAL INVADERS...the hipocracy of Mexicans
Shoot them all then build a wall.
Put a 50 % tax on ALL money transfers to Mexico, Central and South America and the problem would solve itself. They would quickly realize it is not worth it to work in the U.S. and the ones that do come and work you could use that tax money for migrant worker programs such as housing food and medical.
good idea!
Why don&#39;t they show the video where the illegals are throwing rocks at the border patrol and where they injured a Mexican cop in that riot?
Yes yes yes this is going great
Thank you President Trump
Why aren&#39;t the major news networks covering this? CBS doesn&#39;t have news crews in San Diego? WORTHLESS!!!!
CNN and others divide USA
Criminals leaving trash and stealing. Send them to Canada or Paris, they talk the talk,...
COOL! You don&#39;t mess with our heroic POTUS Trump. He got balls &amp; my RESPECT.
Great news!
They should just use force to stop them. This is sad but we have to take care of home first.
The US just has to find the way to have people from other countries come here to do good. If they are arrested they send them all back. Irish to Ireland, Italians to Italy, Greeks to Greece, Dominicans to DR, etc.
why doesn&#39;t the media report that most Americans don&#39;t want the invaders to cross into the USA and agree with what Trump is doing.üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°
Just end this . Open fire and stop wasting everyone&#39;s time
Unbelievable. This has to be stopped
They did surgery on the grape
Caravan Invaders!
What horrible undeserving. Self serving ungrateful immigrants.
The United States is made of immigrants. At some point past present and future people from all over the world have made their way to the US. Some are good people and some aren&#39;t.
such a one sided images.... just women and children!!!! god damned fake media at its best....
Shut the ENTIRE border down! For most up to date news, follow RKTNN
They could film the entire thing but they won&#39;t because cover up.
These micros is invaders they don&#39;t know who they&#39;re messing with they obviously taking President Trump very lightly they&#39;re trying to push his push the envelope they&#39;re going to get something they don&#39;t want several months with all the lines that they have and everything else it&#39;s not the ones with criminal records that means most of these people will not get Asylum and I&#39;ll get turned back to go home if they cause any violence or get arrested
Oh My God!!!<br />Were actually doing it!!!<br />Were finally protecting the border!!!
Thank You President Trump for keeping your promise to protect our border.
la bien se√±ora No. Green Card no tengo Mamacita! Orgullosamente fui echo en USA.
Seguro ya tienes tu green card por eso solo pensas en vos felicito.... es obio q entendiste eres mas hispano q un jalape√±o
Meanwhile at the Canadian/ U.S. border.... We are open!Come on in and get you some flapjacks!
It was the U.S. that tear gassed the protesters, only after they had climbed and breached the fence. It wa really funny to see them scour like cockroaches.
I wonder how much more of this Mexico will put up with
When you knock on someone&#39;s door and they say your not welcome and you insist and push your way in that&#39;s an invasion. Who does that?
They all are Running for white house apprentice open spot. Only the best and most criminals can join the trump train. <br />Maga
I don&#39;t know who&#39;s the LUNATIC who BRAINWASHED this illiterate people. All this people have to do is to start farming their land in their country. They want easy life that&#39;s why. they want to come here for us tax payers to feed them. They have no education and no skills to survive. Most of them I am sure are carriers of TUBERCULOSIS or Hepatitis.
Build the darned WALL!!
Its gonna get ALOT WORSE ,ALOT !!
Didn&#39;t think I would ever see a day where mexican nationals are defending the usa border
Another promise kept thank you mr. Trump!
Machine guns and Hand Grenades and the problem will be solved
These are INVADERS, NOT MIGRANTS! (Migrants move legally.). <br />Of course, the FAKE NEWS globalist media focuses on the very few women &amp; children instead of the FACT that they are 95% military aged men and many hardened criminals and Communists. Traitors help invaders by calling them &quot;migrants&quot;,
Why are some of them hiding their faces with ski masks and bandanas.
The trash news media wont show that 90% of these people are young adult males. They act so tuff. If they are why don&#39;t they go back and fight the government where they came from. Cowards!
500 migrants in Tijuana?? Your evidence?? Could it be significantly more?? Tear gas used?? &#39;Might&#39; be used?? Unsubstantiated BS reporting as usual all designed to make the present administration look evil and brutal. It ain&#39;t working this time, CBSN.
This is our sovereignty as a nation that we are seeing stomped on by people from another country. This has gone on long enough. We here in the great nation has helped more people around the world then any other in WORLD HISTORY. We do not owe anyone anything, Asylum is for persons running away from certain death.
God bless america
Shut down all the borders
Where did they get the foot Bridges
Its time for the aliens, to leave Mexico and go home!
RESPECT OUR LAWS!!!!<br />It‚Äôs biblical <br />A nation HAS BORDERS or it is no longer a nation!
Why does it take an immigration crisis for you all to suddenly start worrying about the homeless/vets
So many people used as pawns in a very dangerous game of polictical chicken. This is not going to end well for anyone, if they stay on that path.
Who do these people think they are, chanting, waving the Honduran flag, storming the Border like they are entitled to push their way through
Trump is a Joke
James 4:7 KJV Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. The Holy Bible, King James Version. Standardized Text of 1769 Public Domain
Gonna keep saying Trump was lying when he called in an invasion you dipshits...you all will never learn..not until it is too late. And lets not forget....these &quot;women and children&quot; all sure do look like military aged men....but we wont talk about that.
Only take the ones in who want to integrate and be American. The haters can hike back to Honduras... They&#39;re not entitled to our tax dollars, foodstamps, welfare, &amp; unemployment. We already have too many chonchitas with tons of kids (all with different deadbeat fathers)
Thank you. Oh the irony of the fact that mexico doesnt want to use its resources to help the immigrants ü§î
Shoot a few and they&#39;ll think it twice.
I don&#39;t want my future grandchildren to come to me one day and ask, &quot;Grandma? What&#39;s a country??&quot;
Trump is showing MAJOR strength to the rest of the world especially EUROPE where they were invaded. Right now Europeans are seeing this and wishing they had a leader with this strength. This is a legacy defining day. Similar to the breaking of the Belrin Wall ironically.
Trump is a man of his word. Glad he&#39;s not messing around.
Every last one of them a vote for insanity. Vote in 2020
This needs to stop now! That‚Äôs not a peaceful people those are invaders
Trump and the Trumpettes are causing this problem!!
no this is Republican and Democrat a like that does not want to uphold the United States laws
It&#39;s almost kind of like Black Friday madness...only if the Black Friday crowds invaded the store, buckle down refused to leave and yet decided to keep all the merchandise for free because they feel entitled to it for some odd unexplained reason.
<a href="https://youtu.be/0PXsh5ZA1GU">https://youtu.be/0PXsh5ZA1GU</a>
Trump 2020!
Just look at this BS. Half of those who &#39;made it to the border&#39; were actually smiling as they were retreating. This is a game to them! And Soros and the Global Elites aren&#39;t soon going to run out of money to empower them further. We&#39;d better get serious or this is going to be an epic failure. There&#39;s a reason that there is no entity nation mentioned in the &quot;last days&quot; prophecies that can be identified as the U.S. Either it&#39;s gone, or it has become insignificant!
Please wake me up, this newscaster, very boring....let&#39;s liven it up, send her back to midnight shift
They should have ordered the border fence from <a href="http://fencetown.com/">FenceTown.com</a> - would have held up better.
Close all of them for good!
Usa lucky now lead by trump.... ..can u all imagine if hillary won election 2016..must be usa flood by illegal imigrant
All these migrant people need to follow our laws. My parents waited over a decade before being able to come to the U.S. legally and they were living worse than what these people have back in Hondorus or whatever they came from. My parents had no phone or technology device, they only had clothes and money on them when they got here. Where my parents came from, they only had a house made of bamboo, sticks, and woods living in the mountains with a small plot of land to farm.
I don&#39;t agree with Trump on a lot of things but on this one she has my approval if we don&#39;t stop these people from coming into our country America will be a Spanish-speaking nation in no time, I agree that there should be a process into citizenship and people should not be allowed to just come here as they please and stay and use up our resources, it&#39;s gotten so bad if you&#39;re not bilingual in English and Spanish it&#39;s hard to find a job in the United States of America it&#39;s obscene
So...Trump is right
Yay!!!!<br />Close the boarders üôåüá∫üá∏üíñ
CBS with a BBC in Tijuana....
They don&#39;t get to run the show.
if these folks are allowed to cross into the US and apply for asylum, what&#39;s to stop the Chinese from allowing a couple million of its citizens to head towards US shores by boats?

Por que el gobierno sigue dando de comer a estos invasores <br />Nos van a convertir en complices por ayudar a esta invasion
Why does the MX GOV. Keep feeding and sheltering these Invaders. This will make Mexico accomplice to this Invasion
Why even have borders and different states? So stupid. We are all humans living on earth. Move where you want. These people in the caravan are no more dangerous then any of the &quot;Americans&quot; we already have. There&#39;s always a few bad apples. but there&#39;s always one big bad orange!
Stop the invasion
Close it down Trump and keep America safe....America first.....
+Kristina Winter is that a threat christina???
danny breeding Isn‚Äôt that fat orange lump of lard dead yet? It won‚Äôt be long now!
Mexico should have never ever let them cross the border in Guatemala now how are they going to get them out of their country that&#39;s on them but please please don&#39;t let them in our country they don&#39;t look very peaceful anymore do they what about the flags are carrying of their own country what about your cell phone they all got one
Daaaamn... They country dont want them , nor do amerikkka! So sad
Anyone who feels like reporting racist / violent comments in the comment section, the place can always use a good clean up, Theres a lot.
Show them throwing rocks
But the MSM told us the caravan wasn&#39;t real and that they are harmless ppl walking without shoes as Obama said. So clearly what we are seeing here and what we&#39;ve been seeing build up for weeks must not be true. So no problem , nothing to see here lets all be in denial. SMH
YESSSSSS. MAGA 2020
500 migrants. they act like ots 50000. deal with it. now we have an emergency? I smell distraction. 500 can just be arrested. in sure we always have at least 500 in the jails awaiting deportation anyway
More MSM lies and distortions. They cut out the rest of Trump&#39;s Tweet, It&#39;s mostly military-aged men who have refused AID, JOBS and even FOOD from Mexico. Let them in and watch this GROW--<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYCbdQ2uF8c">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYCbdQ2uF8c</a>
God bless our president. He told the UN to shut up also. These invaders will learn respect and structure. And Mexico can deal with them first.
Shudder-down!
MEXICO IS PAYING FOR IMPEACHMENT COSTS
America is Land of Immigrants, All are welcome here.
Winta is coming and the horde of un educated along with it. We must defend the wall. We need the dragon queen (Melania) and Jon snow (Trump). To lead their armies to the wall.<br />Greyworm (kanye)<br />Sir Davos (gulianni)<br />Little fingers?<br />Sansa ?<br />Aryia ?<br />Lannister family?<br />Help me out.
Mexico needs to man up and round them all up and send them back.
Wait they cannot get a video from the USA border? Or do they just don‚Äôt want to show is this?
How come I have to go through intense TSA inspections just to fly around the US and these guys can cross our national border without inspection or consequences for their forced illegal entry?
I wonder what Brook Baldwin and CNN will have to say about this tomorrow.
Keep them out! Millions around the world want to come! If we let these thousands in then we will see much much more of this!
THEY NEED LOTS OF RUBBER BULLETS &amp; TEAR GAS &amp; KEEP THOSE DOGGIES MOVING BACK TO WHERE THEY CAME FROM,
Yes, yes, yes
This whole event is being orchestrated and is paid for. That is what this so called &quot;news&quot; source is failing to tell you. Problem, Reaction, and Solution. Their just waiting for the outrage now and will offer up their pre planned solution that will NOT be good for any of us!
They have sign to respect them well they are disrespected our troops and our soldiers pulling the fences down B&#39;s. Teargas them
thank u usa.
univision and telemundo spanish television keep making invitations to this people, there is one per that is very active on this mater JORGE RAMOS.
More Proof Why We Need To Close The Border !
That looks like an invasion
All Trump sees is $$. I doubt he would respond this way if the migrants were Norwegian.
We need to stand together and we are strong together America let&#39;s support our president it&#39;s our home land he is the only true fighter who is fighting for our safety our country is beautiful let&#39;s keep it beautiful and secure from these criminals , Invaders god bless America God bless Mr President
They are violent breaking fenc s.stay out of our neighborhoods.
I thought they wouldn&#39;t be here for weeks/months ?!?!?! Yeah right haha....
If people use these means to force entrance into Your country, will they be law abiding citizens from then on ? Or is it rather that they will continue with those means to press through with whatever agenda they have and whatever they want from then on ? -- And if I might add a question: How many countries have let these mobs through ?
Brown on brown violence, the future of America. Diversity is our strength! Those Mexicsan&#39;s are racist. Hispanic are Marxists and Marxist always eat there own.
If USa wants to be the police of the World then govern these caravanas by open the golden gates or stop the intervention, santions, coup d&#39;etat and bring back all militar bases of their countries.
Soros will give them guns, just like ISIS.
Of course this doesn&#39;t help their cause any, go home use your energies to fix your own country. Tired of free loaders, come in legally, get a real ssn and pay your taxes. It is obvious what we see in the news, those people have zero intention of following or learning any laws.
But why do guys cover up trump don&#39;t you realize that he are that one ne offended M13 that&#39;s when they started burning that mountain s in L A California and now the caravan I wonder what next?
Tear gas won&#39;t do anything to them!<br />The gas they&#39;re relieving themselves is worse than that!
It took them off the fence pretty fast
KEEP AMERICA SAFE
Nothing new they planned this was expected but where&#39;s militery at.
Courts will not uphold Trump&#39;s right to do this!
Oh...now I see why we elected Trump.
&quot;Muh democrat take gud care of meh&quot;
The invasion has begun!
The Cartel is going to start killing those migrants. They got the crossing shut down , its gonna get crazy
I guess Maria can&#39;t go to Mexico and pick up but that don&#39;t stop her from buying and selling drugs in Kern county
Either get a backround check, or leave. Case close.
Es por qu√© √©l Gobierno de M√©xico lo per mite
A lot of hate in these comments. I hope you people never have to go through what these folks are enduring because you&#39;d probably give up, roll over and die without a fight for a better life
Donald Trump is garbage.
Why don&#39;t they just wave a big flag that says future Democratic voters?
interesting to see a cbs comment section mostly against the migrant caravan(s)
All the cameras and no one has any video of anything??? They are talking to this reporter on the phone??? Give me a break!!! Stop frigging around with this and send these illegals BACK to their countries! We don&#39;t want them!!! We have our own to take care of!!!

Guess they have to learn the hard way what the meaning of RESPECT is.<br />Trump, humiliate these people and show them the POWER you possess, and who is BOSS.

If these immigrants had a better reputation they would be welcomed with open arms. So many of them have been hurting America&#39;s sons and daughters or using their little service jobs to persecute the homeless or any American down on his/her luck.
They should have taken the offer by Mexico if they really wanted and feared for their lives. I don&#39;t feel sorry for them.
Stacey ** that‚Äôs how you know these people are nothing but freeloaders. If I lived somewhere and had no job and no money and went to my neighboring country and they offered everything I didn‚Äôt have if take it in a heartbeat.
I blame Mexico for this, for not stoping this in there southern border. Enrique Pe√±a Nieto<br />is a weak President.
But Obama said In his voice and Mickky Mouse Voice that there wasn&#39;t a caravan invasion.
cool US was to weak teagrding this issue go migrant one wave to go enter US yallah
This is cruel. Nationalism is disgusting. These are asylum seekers who have every right to go through asylum process just like a white refugee would be allowed to do. Children will suffer. This is so sad.
Fleas on a dog. These people don&#39;t want to follow any rules or have any respect for the US. They want free stuff. Freeze George soros bank acconts and make him pay for it. If we can freeze iran, why not George soros?¬† Iran isn&#39;t bother us anyway.

Do the same thing y&#39;all did when the Irish and Italians arrived.....open an Ellis island type facility at major border stations, give immunizations, social security number, and settle them in less populated areas or in welcoming communities.....next case!

This people from central America are some fuckend stubborn fuckend people my god, the mexican people of tijuana had a protest of thousands telling them to go back to there central american countrys that they where not welcone in tijuana and the united states. They where specifically told they are not staying in nexico and that the united states are not gonna let them in and they are still fuckend there trying to get in, next up the mexican military is coming and thats when its gonna get real ugly couse they are some serious motherfuckend people in that military there that have been doing the most vicious fighthing against cartels they are used to dealing with narco traffickers brutality and this central americans are gonna find out first hand what being extremly violated really means they are gonna scream for the united states to come saved them after the mexican military deals with them
üó£Let them honest people in. This great land is for everybody
I&#39;m beginning to think these guys are hired by Republicans to fake prove their narrative.
Everyone needs to stand up and help Trump to protecting American soil not fighting and build the walls
In the history of America, each group except the natives and blacks have been called invaders.
*AMERICA 1507*
But I thought MSM wanted us to believe the caravan wasn&#39;t real? I&#39;m confused.
How come none of you noticed when Obama brought in more than 100,000 supposed refugees from the Middle East ? That was a few years back. One of them runs a local gas station.<br />Convenient. üòí
Why didn&#39;t this happen when white people came? <br />Please send white people Back.<br />-Comanche Nation
There is a device used in front of us embassies that is like A-bomb that projects thousands of little rubber balls I think we need like 4 thousand of those.
Thank you Mr. President , you gave many people migrating back and forth the opportunity to become Americans and stay and live in the U.S. and give back to society by paying taxes. Thank you for protecting Americans.
so not 1 person got in?
50k to feed them and revenue loss and expenses,,, 200 million a day on both sides.
Shut it down and keep it shut, stop supplying them with food they&#39;ll soon leave.
Wonder the CNN NBC and others fake news networks &#39; OBAMA with the Democrats were saying no cravan invasion what are they saying now ?they are so betrayed the Americans and the president was right they are people enemies
Mexico is to blame for letting them into the country, very weak government for not protecting their southern border!shame!!!!!üò§
Break out the mustard gas hodedos!!
...Country roads...
All central Americans it&#39;s criminals ! Deported
There was something fishy about this. First, how does the caravan arrive three weeks before the timing anticipated by our government and why would they take a path that is geographically a greater distance then the entry point in Brownsville Texas. Just doesn‚Äôt wash. I think there is a huge manipulation by both our government and the media that is taking place.These are supposed to be refugees from the Honduras. There is no way that they would across the entire country of Mexico, then go along our border when they could‚Äôve entered in Tucson and try to enter in Tijuana. It is geographically not plausible. I think this one is being staged.
Great Job President Trump . Thank You !
I jus say, b careful how I treat people bc one day u may b crawling to their land. Amercia is losing its standing in the world bc of greed and the removal of a moral standard. There is a lot US has to pay for and need to repent from. B careful when pride , greed and racIan is allowed to rule the day as well as seeing homosex marriage as a legal right

Technically they&#39;re trying to cross over into the part of Mexico that the US illegally stole
Mob rule is the culture democrats want to import here illegally.

If they put half of this effort to enter America into their countries, they may not be the shitholes they are today.
they gunna rape our women and smoke our weed n take our guns!
shoot these filthy animals shoot ,they are coming you and your property
Set up some machine gun nest along the canal and open fire when they try to cross that river. That will make them think twice.
Close all the ports. I stand with our president
Notice that CBS, a so called American broadcaster, uses a BBC reporter, based 6000 miles to the east for on the ground reports. And Why is that the case, why not an American reporter??<br /><br />We are getting VERY much better reports from Tijuana residents themselves.
Trump ain&#39;t joking. Usa supports him fully.
+Roberto Nestaj All those in favor of open unsecured borders should have all illegal immigrants sent to their home? They shouldn't lock their doors neither. üòíüòíüòí
This USA doesn't.
CBS fake stream media could have easily showed us actual footage but chose to use a BBC correspondent via phone and show pictures of women and children for the most part but I seen a live video that shows these men on the border fence rushing at one time starting fires dragging and trampling over children one full leave in had an actual ladder Sam got over the fence but border patrol and law enforcement fired teargas and use the sound weapon to repel them hundreds of men. Watch RKTNN News Network with Randell K Taylor to get the real news here on YouTube these fake stream media agencies are going to push the women and children narrative and hide the truth!
+wesley rodgers good keep the liberal traitors we don't want them they are brain washed idiots.

Not so tough now . There is a reason mexico is ranked 35th in the world and the USA #1 . These illegals thought they could do the same to us as they did mexico . Trump is president not obama . Force has been authorized . GO HOME .
Shooooooooooot
Must be some mistake, I was assured before the midterms that this caravan was months away and that Trump was just scaremongering. Surely the media wouldn&#39;t deliberately report fake news, would they?

don&#39;t know why we closed the south bound border. let people go south, just not back. i&#39;m ok with that.
With today‚Äôs technology, you‚Äôd THINK we‚Äôd have MASSIVE barriers that burst out of the grounds surrounding our country ‚Äî to keep illegals out. How do you maintain a country if EVERYONE is allowed in?
Why are they marching and demonstrating waving the flags of their countries? What makes them think they have the right to to crash our borders? Their signs are demanding respect? Why do they deserve respect?
That's the Mexican flag. The Mexicans in Tijuana are protesting against the caravan migrants. Their signs say, " I RESPECT YOUR RIGHTS, SO RESPECT MY COUNTRY." They're asking for the caravan migrants to be more respectful while they're in Tijuana. So. . . there you go. Also the caravan is composed of South American countries, meaning people from countries that aren't Mexico.
The only thing that I like Trump for is how he&#39;s handling this.
Pinchis gringos locos hahahahahahahahahaha
El bordero el closedo
I‚Äôm stuck in Tijuana!
Eating some tacos while I wait.
And hows it going??
My coworker is from Honduras and he says there‚Äôs no crisis whatsoever there. His whole family lives there and says everything is fine.Just a opportunity to come here.
ted Clauss I bet you want the freedom to live wherever on earth you want to. Is that only applicable if you are white? Oh and the irony, just look at who you are employing üëèüëèüëèüëè
+Truck Taxi of course there are facts. but people opinions are subjective. and that's the context we're talking about.
+BlueBell22 it's not all subjective there are some actual facts like what is GDP what is GNP what is the annual income how did it compare to other countries and here's a really big one how much does the national economy depend on remittances (money sent to family members in Honduras that are employed outside of the country).
SSG Squidward they cant take my job.
ted Clauss they tewk err jewbs
Mr Chillin I understand.
ted Clauss That's ridiculous These people are liars
Rojas...his coworker didnt come with thousands of marching caravan for sure like these people doing storming the border like an invading army
ted Clauss then why is he over here
+Ed Osborne my point is, people can say it's great there or bad, it's all subjective regardless.
BlueBell22 No, their claims have to be processed first by a court.
I also have two employees who say the samething
+Ed Osborne same can be said for a "caravan".
ted Clauss The testimony of one family is now taken as fact for an entire country.
I would just shut all of the border.
Shoot them,,good target practice.
Was that the sole female in the caravan?
Yes. She was on birth control. 80% of all women in these caravans end up raped, quality people.
Running Debate no that was one of the tranys they were talking about.
MAGA Trump 2020
welcome migrants, contact cnn news,we can get you a job at Swift transportation, welcome migrants.
so many conservatives going full drama queen and calling it an invasion.<br />why dont these drama queens ask when the trump republicans, who control all 3 branches of government till DEC 31, build the promised wall?<br />trump makes the drama queens the necessary idiots of conservatism by promising a wall for votes, and then delivering a border shutdown.
The White House need to find a way to get our people back across the border I‚Äôm a truck driver and I would have hated to went into Mexico and to find out on my way back I was stuck
Bad timing and stupidity on their part does not make it a crisis on ours..
Trump is going to build a flying bridge after he done raking the forests in Pleasure, CA
I have family in Tijuana and my grandma and I are citizens but she goes the weekends to see my Aunt rn is a big problem because we don&#39;t know how she is going to be back here... Otay is packed and she is thinking about going all the way to Tecate... I don&#39;t know why they don&#39;t put all of them in Jail for disturbing
here its will the 2nd amendment idiots will mess it up.
Made move toward NO! They tried to cross it. They made an attempt to rush the border which msm said that was a lie and they weren&#39;t going to do it.
Why Aren&#39;t people Protesting congress, and Petitioning for the funds to build Trumps Wall??? You&#39;re telling me that Democrats are the only ones With the Time and Resources to Organize a Protest when things don&#39;t go their way??? Oh, wait. Never mind. Smh. I keep forgetting that Republicans Actually have Jobs and Pay taxes on time. LoL... Too bad. Because Now would be an Excellent time To Storm Congress, and File Lawsuits against the 9th Ciruit, For Human Rights Violations of Exploitation and The Supporting of Human Trafficking. Smh. But I Digress. <br />Peace and Blessings.
Must have been difficult,<br />to get so many women and children,<br />for your subliminal slanted report.
Trump needs to not only shut the border down.but shut the Government down.
Look at this propaganda. I&#39;m glad trump is president rather than how Hillary would of handled this situation.
Migrants? Invaders enough of the PC bs it&#39;s an invasion.
+Kristina Winter nice try socialist open borders no usa. Get back in the basement NPC Large group in the thousands uninvited making demands and threats to rush borders, waving their flags. Action=Invasion Pronoun= Invaders. NPC error! MSM
Dave Rob Talk about an overreaction
I wounded what Hillary would have done if she were president
We don&#39;t want these people here! They are not welcome in US. South America will have to take back their garbage people.
It&#39;s very trajic. Trump has painted much of these migrants as evil. His rhetoric is without evidence. However, no doubt their are some who have criminal motives, but that will be the very few, rather than the many. I understand the necessity to protect the border, I just don&#39;t believe that it will be executed in the right spirit. We live in times where honesty, integrity, grace &amp; compassion are in the gutter..
About time
They are difiant they only want in America without any rules to legalize .or asylum. One can see why all mostly men. To hey need to go back or they may go back in a coffin if things get real violent.
Anyone who agrees with this invasion.....I suggest you leave open the door to your home, invite them in, feed them, house them and give them free health care.
D. Lewis Or let them earn their own seeing as employment is supposed to be so great in the US there must be plenty of vacancies needing to be filled
Roberto Nestaj um yes
D. Lewis they will not do that, Socialist liberals think the government has free money. They don't know that the working class pay taxes to fund their Socialist dreams. Look at what is going on in France right now. Socialism has raised taxes to the braking point and the cost of living is sky rocketing. California residence know what I'm talking about.
Roberto Nestaj I think you misunderstood the point of what DontBlameTheDog said.
Liberals are too stupid to think like that.
Is that how your ancestors came here, living in someones house? +DontBlameTheDog Didn't think so..
Oh they couldn't possibly do that. They're all talk, but want someone else to do what they won't.
Why don&#39;t trump go to Central America and make them great again
Why don't you, central America isn't trump problem
FINALLY!!!!! A President that takes charge!!!!! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23MAGA">#MAGA</a>
Cnn,cbs,msn what do you not understand the American ppl do not want them here Mexico does not want them there we owe them nothing are troop protect other countrys boarders all the time they are protecting the laws of America get real stop fight fornon citizens
They are coming to rape Republican familys only
Asylum is for if you&#39;re in a dangerous situation not because you are paid
Dennis Natale. Agreed. Check out the Honduras; doubting you'd like to move there with your family.
Way to go Prez!!
Mark 7 verse 9. Matthew chapter 25 verse 31 thru 46. GOD will deal with trump.
If America&#39;s CIA, FBI, Homeland, and special interest groups just avoided destabilizing Central America back in the 60&#39;s, 70&#39;s and 80&#39;s none of this would of happened.
Deport trump
+jake hansen fake fox news.and deport his family and administration too
Awww is someone upset that CNN lied to them? and there is a caravan of non Americans heading to america to come in illegally...
better yet deport yourself.
Blame Mexico for not securing there borders.
Retuen those people
Thanks Trump. The resources that would be wasted on these people are better used on the many Americans in need this holiday!
On black Friday, the one day that sales are to be the highest. What ever expected sales they just went up in smoke. Migrants and Mexico authorities don‚Äôt seem to be bother if they notice at all. Migrants all keep repeating, we don‚Äôt want to bother anyone while the disaster is all around them. One migrant said, we see all these as a joke, as if to say we don‚Äôt fear the military. Again, completely ignoring how much they are setting all the grown ups back. They are like children taking grown up actions
OBAMA lies lies
Mexico needs to deport these people.
All the cops are busy ima
Yeah team America!!!
I love how they only show women and children. Bunch of damn fake news.
Digital Dazzle Photography I hope trump continues to do good
Bye Felicia...
WAIT I THOUGHT THIS WAS A LIE TRUMP MADE UP TO SCARE PEOPLE FOR THE MIDTERMS..
I have family flying from Mexico city to the Tijuana airport . Hopefully this doesn&#39;t keep them from coming in and yes they have visas lol
Time for the military to &quot;proactively&quot; defend our border from the Invaders<br />Obviously, teargas is not enough
MegaRudyray not yet buddy. But they come across you will wish you was ü§¨
David Council yep i agree they joined up to defend Americans. Because some of us still have rights to defend our land and families. And here in south we will do just that so. Use the military to do it first üî•ü§¨because I personally hate wasting ammunition
Number one Duno üòÇüòÇüòÇSUPER‚ùÑÔ∏èüòÇüòÇüëèüëèüëè
David Council Wait you are American are you sure you don‚Äôt want them to get the sub machine guns out, that‚Äôs more your style
+Number one Duno Apparently you don't frequent strip clubs, because it rains money there all the time.
MegaRudyray They are throwing rocks, and debris at border guards. Haven‚Äôt you ever heard the term, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt bring a knife to a gun fight‚Äù? I‚Äôm not sure what kind of results they think that is gonna get them. I hope it gets them shot. That will slowdown the caravan a bit. They are coming for my tax dollars. What do they think? That it rains money on this side of the border?
Martinez Ana When you carry the flag of your country, and you march in a group towards a foreign border... it‚Äôs an invasion. They should be shot as soon as they cross illegally. They are enemy invaders, making demands, and being violent about it. It‚Äôs not America‚Äôs fault their only weapons are rocks and sticks. Asylum seekers should come humbly, and in peace, carrying the flag of the country in which they seek asylum!
David Council ..why is nobody talking about Canadian border...oh. that's right middle eastern people are not violent.?
Gene Apodaca some of those videos where actually Mexicans protesters, protesting about the asylum seekers being in there country! That‚Äôs why they where holding the Mexican flag so much! When they where marching or holding signs it was a protest against the asylum refugees not the asylum seekers themselves.
+Martinez Ana what do you call what they did at Mexico's southern border? Looks a lot like invasion to me
Yup defend this nation
+Martinez Ana they know they can't cross illegally but they will try
It's not an invasion! An invasion wouldn't happen at a legal port of entry.
Take it easy Rambo, those people are not armed.
But but but ... it‚Äôs not in invasion the libtards said ... what are hundreds of people holding the flag of another country storming your border called ??????
This is an invasion bought and paid for things will just get worse and more violent for Mexico call and America.
What trips me out is they refused asylum and jobs in Mexico. They could&#39;ve taken that then migrate to the US later. Sadly, this is unacceptable.
Se√±or Jos√© apparently you are wrong on that.
They declined the offer by MEXICO. MEXICO KNEW all they want is cross through the reason why let them in. So let them deal with their mess. For the USA all are illegal invaders and should not be allowed in. No border no country! It is that simple.
+Stupid Goigle actually it's 5000
Mexico pays nothing and their asylum means nothing. US has the money. You get thrown on the street as a homeless person in Mexico.
Most stayed in Mexico the rest of them are invaders.
nobody said they were smart just a caravan of pendejos.
Stupid Goigle What a üò´‚ùÑÔ∏èyou are üòÇ
Victor Montalvo Yes jobs in Mexico. It is a functioning country.
Jobs in Mexico üòÇüòÇüòÇü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
Adron Lamb that s really their problem isn't it though ? If . , as they say, they re running form horrible violence and will die......but they are complaining about a job and asylum? kinda smells bad docntcha think?
They dont want jobs.. They want to leach off our system.
They never wanted jobs and asylum in Mexico. What trips me out is how stupid everyone is
Because they want socialist Democrats to feed them and house them and give give give....go back to where they came from....cockroaches....
Se√±or Jos√© the donald is creating distractions because he has alienated the press with his poor choices of words it seems. I agree with you too on what to do. its just that they are acting like its 5 million . not 500. how many national guard are there? these people are outnumbered 10 to one anyway
Hevquip but whites are evil and racist, theyll punch you in the face for not being white
apparently Hondurans are racist and only want to be around white culture, as if white countries are better somehow...
Because in Mexico they would have to work, in US they get free stuff get it. Refuse all of them entry 20 million illegals already in is enough.
It was 95% men. Stop showing the very few women with children who are guilty of child abuse by entering those children into violence using them as props.
+Jonathan Reed Well said. I'd change the phrase from Republicans to entitled.
Darrel Turner ,not jelly are we LMAO move on troll
+Guapo you went? Lol for fun did you enjoy your self too?
C Hoc LMAO more important things to deal with.like the no good for nothing immigrants.
Are you you threatened or just insecure?
I'm starting to think this caravan is a paid stunt and of course Robert Mercer has written the check...
Katheryn Holman ... That's because they want to sell drugs here because they know they can't there because the cartel there.

Wrong, this isn't even your country,this land was stolen and never will truly belong to the dirt bag US...

+Joe Crow i thought everybody knew better than to believe what they CHOOSE to show on the news???
+C Hoc your such a dweeb
+HeyDuffy459 Show me a photos on google or any video on the news .
Exactly
You‚Äôre right. It‚Äôs little brown men wanting free stuff from American taxpayers (Republicans).

https://youtu.be/KwPNBl1BEiY DON'T BE STUPID WAKE UP!
1Galan who confirmed it? Last time I checked Fox News it said it was 80% young males under the age of 35.
Ace1King1 the woman are cross dressers and the children are midgets. Who cares illegal is illegal.
Been confirmed that it's 90 to 95% men
HeyDuffy459 no. It is 80% young adult males under the age of 35.
Wait wasn‚Äôt it 80%?
The rightists like bone spur Trump loves props like using the military for photo ops but not visiting the Troops and blowing off WWI ceremony events etc.
I heard it was 100% men. ALL the women and children are PROJECTED HOLOGRAMS!
+SN Project I undersrand your point. My point is look at cali,az,nm,tx prisons and jails are filled with 70% latino men. Thats why the men aspect is important.
It's mostly men what you see is what the news channels want you to see to make you feel sorry for them lol
SN Project Hondurans are not Mexicans.
+HeyDuffy459 that dam sure not true at the TX border I live dam close and there's 30 men to one woman here in this mass of immigrants
Katheryn Holman too bad there are no impartail sources to fact check the percentages anymore......
Katheryn Holman Been to a trailer park lately? I prefer these folks
Mexicans are weird about family, I.e. they want their family to stay home because, that is home, whether or not they like it to be, it is home. So, the responsibility of finding work and keeping home "safe" financially, and making the dangerous journey, falls on "the man" /typically/. Whether that's a son, or father, kind of up to the situation. These are people who often have no hope to get work that will keep their family alive in the long term, brcause their countries are poorly run, they're trying to find that safety, somewhere.
What's wrong with 95% males entering, women and children can't cause nowhere near as much damage in the U.S.
HeyDuffy459 You're so full of crap.
Oh come on lady. Think for yourself instead of living in Trump's alternate reality.
+Turtle I was there two days ago and it was 75 percent women and children.
Katheryn Holman. CBS, NBC and CNN will NEVER show the real truth. They're just too steeped in their liberal mindset. And that's never going to change.
It is selective filming and photographing by the left leaning media. Look at candid photos of large groups.

+HeyDuffy459 well I was there yesterday it's mostly male hardly any female and kids.
+MegaRudyray ya all 13 are women!
Lol. Maybe you just have bad info. I see a bunch of women and children too.
+Guapo You went? What, just to wait in line for a little while? Lol, maybe get a few selfies?
I went and it is mainly young men
Oh wow, you were there?

Lady Liberty still reads,,, ‚ÄúGive me your tired, your poor, <br />Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, <br />The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. <br />Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed, to me: <br />I lift my lamp beside the golden door.‚Äù............... Figure it out!! that&#39;s the Racist CLOWNS job..
Kassy Kassie look up Obama‚Äôs speech on how he wanted more troops to the border and wanted to deny all immigrants that try to come here illegally. Lol. It has nothing to do with race. It‚Äôs about LEGAL immigration. Not storming our border and coming illegally with no respect. I‚Äôm first generation US born in my family. I love that we are a country of immigrants. My family did it the legal right way and we are proud of it. It absolutely needs to be reformed and streamlined. But your comments are idiotic and ignorant. Please never vote.....on anything....ever. Lol
Do you people not have any sympathy?!?! These people are desperate! Maybe try to HELP them and maybe they&#39;ll stop trying to cross the border!
+hevquip I'm Irish. They might need a boat
then go help them lol. you got a place for them to stay, right?
GOOD!!!!!! They have NO RIGHT to demand anything.

+michael mccandless I'll shoot your mom

Pamela Bergner Thanks you Pamela. How in the H3LL can they demand something for US!!! What they should have mobilized for and demanded. Is for their government to do right by their citizens. They were too scared to demand anything there. So march a thousand miles and demand something for a foreign Country.
Shoot them all dead now. Not later. Shoot them now!!! üò° we don&#39;t want you fuckers here. Mexico doesn&#39;t even want y&#39;all.

+Mad 1976 well you live in California and you got them kind of people working for you well maybe if you paid American people a little more money instead of paying these people under wages
Huh? Explain how our tax dollars educate immigrants.. Also how you know about 10K peoples "work skills", Also what education do you have for your job?

+Mad 1976 - Sick of hearing that lie that immigrants/undocumented do jobs us Americans don't want to do....Who were doing those jobs before they got here....poor whites and disadvantaged blacks were for minimum wage, protected by state and fed employment laws. Now employers can pay pennies (literally) and ignore laws. Also, who needs public assistance when you get to keep all of your pay. Between the 1% and undocumented, somebody's paying for the state and fed governments to remain open, fund wars, social programs and wasteful spending. Guess who?

+Cam 1 Then how did Trump get in?
Sounds right tighten up immigration laws. Sucks to be them, but cant save everyone or everything. I will just pray they find peace and prosperity.
62% of every American TAX DOLLAR goes directly to the object of building more bombs, bullets and boobytraps, for the extermination by extreme violence, of non-Christians and Christians alike. FIVE BILLION DOLLARS, if you use your brain, was the amount of CASH that the Pentagon simply lost in Iraq. No accounting. They just LOST billions of dollars while invading a country that had done nothing against the USA. If believers in the monster in the sky would just start paying a little attention when they set out to blow the guts out of 100,000 Iraqi women and children, they might have saved a few billion dollars along the way. Unfortunately, their wimpy-assed god has done nothing to help them. (Could that be because the god of the Jews, Muslims and Christians is the same deplorable baby raping monster?)
Tensa.......Perfectly said!

I‚Äôd suggest people should go home and bear arms, protect what they expect for living conditions, clean it up, instead of giving their nation away. Call for assistance, they would certainly get it. No, sounded like a better idea to get paid to ‚Äúwalk‚Äù for months to the border, where, uh how old are these people? and why is this the first time it sounded like a good idea? Yeah, call Soros to bail you out of this, you know where the money is coming from. The ‚Äúcaravan‚Äù has women who have meticulously applied their eyeliner and have sprayed their hair in place, the one baby born during this ‚Äúcaravan‚Äù had new clothes that I wouldn‚Äôt have found here for my children.

how can i avoid being gangraped if they get in?
If they get in forget it raping and crime thru the roof.
Shoot them or move to the east
If you cross a border this way in China, Poland, Great Britain or where ever what do you think will happens ?
Athena SuperHeldin 1. I am unaware of genocide occurring in Honduras. They just want more money. Not a valid reason to be granted asylum. 2. The UK has no land border (unless you count Ireland/ N. Ireland). You would be singing a different tune if you did. I was under the impression that you lot voted for Brexit to keep out Romanians and Poles looking to make a bit more money, and utilize your health services. These people just as bad. 3. Thank you for demonstrating that the British education system is not as wonderful as many have claimed. I'm happy your laws are being upheld. Would you care to take them in?
Sven Kreuzberg Why would Britain need a wall when it‚Äôs surrounded by water? On the subject of water the coastline of the USA mammoths the Mexican boarder as do the skies. Think ü§î
Athena SuperHeldin Womp womp
+Athena SuperHeldin and THIS is why you are a Brit and we are Americans. 'thats for the people in charge to decide.' no, the world decided on what is considered cause for asylum. Better wages ain't one! Cheers!!
Athena SuperHeldin latinos destroyed their own countries with socialism.
+Athena SuperHeldin and they can apply for asylum. But they know they will be denied and instead choose to try and cross illegally. I can sympathize they want more opportunity but there's a legal way to do it. I have aunts and uncles that waited almost 10 years to get here legally. Why do these people have a right to do it illegally in your opinion?
Athena SuperHeldin oh really so then why would you want to come to the country that so called destroyed yours ?
+mike taylor those kinds of things are decided by the officials who are responsible for finding out if their reasons are legitimate! Don't you see something in common with these refugees though? The refugees come from central american countries....which were exploitated by The American Government. The gov HEAVILY intervened and interfered in their government for DECADES.....DESTABILIZING the region!
+Athena SuperHeldin economic is not a good reason many are economic asylum seekers
Seeking Asylum im Great Britain is a law which is upholded. They actually accept you IF you do have a good reason to seek asylum!
This is nation defense.. barbarians at the gates
if congress does not act right with a wall ,we should take our torches and pitch forks first to the fake media then to congress steps and purge the fake congress people too,and demand a wall ,or a brand new truck like all the immigrants in my hometown have

Costa Rica is really nice too...i have been all over the area and i am really confused why everyone is fleeing? I have never seen any violence down there. Brazil is another story... dont go anywhere w/o good travel plans and a escort from your hotel. Even they major beaches are sketchy. Venezuela, use to be nice...now not so much. It is even crazier. I get why those people are leaving.
I know, it's great: in 20 years you won't have to go to Honduras, Mexico, or Brazil for vacation because they'll have brought so much of that culture here, it's like the United States won't even be the United States anymore!

They&#39;re breaking through fences, throwing rocks at border patrol... NONE of them should be granted asylum.
+Kristina Winter Actually she is because according to International Law asylum seekers must take asylum in the first country they arrive in...which factually was Mexico..and Mexico obliged and offered it. As such they are international criminals.
mrumsower there are many videos of the caravan throwing rocks
Kristina Winter of course not she‚Äôs a women
I agree not one should be let in this country. Tear gas, sound weapons, flash bangs and rubber bullets is what they should get
It is legal to apply for asylum. You can't be mad at them for trying to enter LEGALLY.
Kristina Winter Then it‚Äôs a darned good thing we have President Trump, who will certainly make that decision for us.

Every liberals should take @least one migrant in their home.
+Kristina Winter You're surely not. :)
DoomsieDoll Are you qualified to make that decision? Thought notüòÇ
Everyone was warned border might shut down.they had there chance to leav e..they knew this was going to get bad. If you don&#39;t listen you put your life in danger.
Customs in those countries are such that if a hoard of people showed up at the door of their home insisting on being allowed in they would be shot. They see us as such an easy mark that they figure their bully tactics will get them in. I hate Trump, but this mad rush at our borders is disrespectful, rude and unacceptable. Not only that, we have our own poor here to feed! I hope he makes it so NONE of these bullies are allowed to live here. He should send every single last one away where they have to apply from their homes, first. Then, after a long look at who they are consider whether they should be allowed here.
and tie up our resources? bad idea. someone has to pay for all of what you‚Äôre proposing‚Äî think it through

We will enter your country while waving the flag of our oppressors and wear clothing declaring your president a racist. We do not have to follow your laws. We are your responsibility. We will commit acts of violence against your law enforcement because we will enter your country by whatever means necessary. F___ you, Trump, and anyone who tries to stop us.

mike taylor This isn‚Äôt the 1st time this has happened very few are let in. They all get immigration hearings. Trump could have sent more judges to speed up the process. Instead he sent troops before the election.

They don't even read the LAWS. Unbievable the ugly path Trump is leading them, firing fear, hate, chaos, distrust.

Which planet are the from?
Enough. Time for any of the so called migrants that doesn&#39;t accept the asylum and job offer in Mexico needs to be arrested and deported to their country of origin.
The reason they don't take Mexico's offer is because they see the United States as the only country that can help them. Everyone wants to go the United States. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
+arjaygee you're right, international law of asylum says you go to the first country from yours and Mexico offered them asylum and they refused. They apparently aren't refugees, weird huh
By international law, it is illegal to deport an alien to a country where they will not be safe.
This is a manufactured crisis by Putin&#39;s puppet.

Wonder how many of the Americans trying to get back were actually helping the migrants? This has been going on for weeks so why would any US citizen put themselves at risk unless they are part of the problem.
More likely, they were working or vacationing in Mexico. Conspiracy theories seem less likely to me.
If Mexico is not able no protect its border, USA can makes it

Everything started a downward spiral in 1492.
+Andreana Calhoun Maybe because it is a stable place they CAN "RUN TO?" They don't seem to have other means of transportation available. Other, FAR BETTER CHOICES, are simply not an option for them. Since the United States did a lot to harm the counties they are coming from, I think we owe them. BUT, I'm sure that is not in any way part of their thinking. THEY ARE DESPERATE! And, I am completely certain that they would be totally willing to take jobs that American citizens are unwilling to accept. (Most people know this as truth...) The United States is a BIG PLACE, surely these SMALL caravans won't make any difference that warrants the ridiculous reaction it is being given. Let's spent our resources on things that cost-effectively help U.S. Citizens and stop magnifying tiny problems, especially when they are grounded in prejudice. YOU used the word LATINOS. Prior to your use of that term, I had never thought of them with a label other than unfortunate human beings. I am so sad that I now have that in my mind.
Next time then why are these latinos running to this so called white country and not somewhere else.
+whatisreality01 Who said WHITE PEOPLE?
+Defy Convention Ah, but, THIS IS DIFFERENT! The pyramids required HIGHLY SKILLED LABOR. Slavery can produce Jeffersonian furniture and architecture, but pyramid building is many times more complex. Forced laborers would lack the motivation to devote themselves to alien-like super precision. (Maybe prejudice...If so, I repent!)
+Walter Archibald highly doubtful, modern people change their "opinions" and "interpretations" all the time, Pluto was a planet, now it isn't, and yet it still exists as it was

Stop making it look like western countries are heavenly and make NO mistakes!
+Athena SuperHeldin slavery existed long before America, you get a history book. Criminal acts and unpaid debts were repaid through slavery in many cultures not to mention children born into slavery through lower class families. Those pyramids in Egypt were built entirely by willing individuals too, right?
I think he's making a reference to Christopher Columbus lol. He's stating the white Europeans, now white Americans are the problem with America.
+Defy Convention Yes, I confess, that I know nothing of the historical geography of that region. So, I am willing to concede. However, I do know that most of these asylum-seekers are victims of U.S. atrocities committed against the governments of the countries where theses people are fleeing from. (Check Noam Chomsky for the reliability of this assertion.)
+Athena SuperHeldin What cultures have slaves now? Suuurely white cultures, right? Right? Oh...no? *Crazy*
+Defy Convention 1492 was before slavery became massive in the west. Get a history book. AND PLUS there are more slaves now than before.

Con R That will make no difference. Suck it up‚ùÑÔ∏è
Baraka Obama True we are suffering but mainly because of many other reasons like the tax reform breaks for the wealthy. And the irony is that the wealthy usually don‚Äôt pay their fair share of taxes anyway. The 12 billion plus bailout to farmers could have paid for a lot of other things-Vets, Immigrants, Elderly... Instead of golf trips to Trump properties and Secret Service for extended family and friends the money could have stayed in the budget. Rather than tent cities where a few are making billions being paid with tax money, they could have had a procedure to vet and hear refugees in a timely manner. So, for you to insinuate that you pay enough taxes and don‚Äôt want to fund refugees is awful and embarrassing that we our not giving human beings a chance to plead their case for entry into this country, why not get angry with the wasted money your taxes pay for.
Vansion. Living Someone is an asylum seeker for so long as their application is pending. So not every asylum seeker will be recognised as a refugee, but every refugee is initially an asylum seeker. So now you know.

+DELEGADO 13 exactly.. the ape planet üòÇüòÇ
SN Project the U.S... No more cheap labor for big bosses and you idiots keep giving your tax cuts to the rich. Which will use them to create robot laborers. Any other question?
Not all of Mexico is control by cartel. Only certain spots. These people are from Honduras, El Salvador and other foreigners mixed in amongst those from the countries that I mentioned.
America is fueling the drug lords... by making the drugs illegal. It's part of their destabilisation technique. It's written in the illuminati's manual "silent weapons for quiet wars" (google it). They try to destroy societies by implementing destructive policies (war on drugs)... just to make everyone poor except themself.
REDD PLANET these aren‚Äôt Mexicans. What if I said use your energy to go back to Africa?
JoRe 51 That makes sense!
REDD PLANET lol
Nostazam Orano LOL
Redd ignore this fools , lots of people get what u are saying . Sorry for the racist comments some of our fellow Americans posted , we know where they can go
+Jason J Okay so, yes I understand that. But the whole system feels tension dude, If someone shot somebody in Florida, I technically shouldn't worry because I'm on the other side of the country, but it's still the country, my country. I should be worried about things affecting my fellow countrymen.
govt and cartels are working together cartels give govt a percentage govt minds their own business comprende.
The quality of a country is directly related to the quality of the people in it.
Right on. These invaders are cowards. They refuse to improve their own countries and instead want to come here for free health care and welfare.
They are Honduras üá≠üá≥ people!!! Not Mexicans !!
Taking out drug cartels is not something the Mexican people can do any more than American civilians can do it in our country. The government needs to do it. But what I don't understand is why Mexico won't ask for our help? Why don't they let US troops in a joint effort with Mexican special forces take out the cartels? That's the question.
REDD PLANET In a perfect world that would me ideal. But time has come a past a long time ago. The drug cartel runs Mexico üá≤üáΩ now.
Exactly some mexicans are staying but doing this is like betraying your own country
Because they arent even mexicans the wont do anything for our country
You are black so your comment don't count, why not say something like " Why is the government not doing nothing in Chicago from all the black on black killings"
+SN Project You hurt Tijuana because only that one border crossing is closed. The rest of mexico is doing just fine.
+Jason J What country does closing our border affect the most though?
+SN Project they are not Mexicans. Mexicans are not going to the u.s like before these are all central Americans
They are not Mexicans you stupid monkey!
Its not that simple. Read up on cartels & mex/us govt corruption if you want to understand.
REDD PLANET did you not watch the video ? Lol Mexican authorities are trying to stop them. It‚Äôs mainly a Honduran caravan
REDD PLANET your living in another planet.
These are people from Central America not Mexican
The big problem for the Mexican government is that you offered a lot of money for drugs mostly cocaine my friend. You are a big part of their problem.
+Manuel Escareno you realize one of the most brutal cartels is from Honduras right!?
For the most part 90% of those people are hondurans and salvadorans
Wow super dumb comment!
REDD PLANET dude.. They are from Honduras.. Not mexico
You clearly don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs going on.
Kind of hard to fight a military-style group (with ties to the actual military) without revolution. They wanted to find shelter before being forced to fight, so this might push towards a revolution in Mexico.
The mexican goverment is ruined by their own selfish leaders . Theres no way of life there.
MMGA (Make Mexico Great Again )
This aren't Mexicans my friend.
They aren't Mexican
REDD PLANET well cartels work for the us government
Cartel will always find a way to bounce back
These are central Americans not Mexicans
REDD PLANET Right on!!!!
But it wasn&#39;t an invasion/S. Stop them. Mexico has offered them asylum and jobs. They refused. Case closed.
Oh, it is an invasion setup by Soros! It all started on election time! Do your research!
America Central Americans don‚Äôt want to work they want handouts
No most stayed in Mexico the rest are invaders.
Tri very true too it can be two sided on one you got a man with his family seeking asylum and on the other you have a very dangerous man lurking among them
+chip chipperson really? When? How?
+Angel Gallegos Were you a beggar?
+Victor Tellez Its not about the quality of work. These invaders were seeking asylum stating they have gangs, war torn country. They found refuge and declined. End of story
America DEPORT the lazy white people who stole this land and massacred the NATIVES,,,,,,white trash
America Mexican people have been terrorized by these people
Angel Gallegos I can appreciate that
Victor Tellez- They were working with businesses to fill vacancies in factories an such. It‚Äôs not as much as working in a US factory buts it‚Äôs enough to get you by. Besides there‚Äôs a video of a farmer from Honduras needing people from Guatemala to work in his field to pick the coffee harvest because the Honduran people don‚Äôt want to do them. Beggars can‚Äôt be choosers!
America I wish that were true Mexico barely has any decent jobs for its own citizens so I imagine if they actually gave them work it would be terrible work or worse they go to the cartels
Cbsn your a dumpster fire that only promotes propaganda
These people have no RIGHTS they&#39;re criminals invaders. I would not even give them water or food. These people think they are ENTITLE to something THEY ARE NOT, ACTING WITH FORCE NEVER END GOOD. PEOPLE DO NOT LIKE TO BE FORCED ESPECIALLY IN THEIR OWN COUNTRY!!!!!!!üò†
I would trade one of them for you any day.
Before long it gone be a whole country of them folks over here its already to many over here then they try an competition with white an black American NATIVES no way we don&#39;t want them
About 500 migrants all ran full speed towards the border at the same time.<br />They were sent running the other way by tear gas.
That was 500 not 10,000 can you imagine what kind of Chaos would take place if 10000 where to charge the Border
Southern Comfort I bet you are afraid of your own shadow BOO!!!
steve b This really is so Pythonesque utterly amusing, The ‚ùÑÔ∏è comments are hilarious.
+Melody Tenisch like they are tourists lol goes to prove that you can't fix stupid...
David Lutz Better tear gas than bullets. They should be thankful for the mercy shown towards them; justice would have been bullets fired at the for their lawlessness
Gas was effective this time.......increase force as needed.......MAGA
Melody Tenisch Melody I take is as they are saying if they illegally cross the boarded. They aren‚Äôt suggesting to take any action unless they do cross. Just like they planned & mobilized to make that long trip to our boarders. In return this is our government and citizens preparing for what‚Äôs to possibly happen. Which is the possibility of illegally crossing.
Melody Tenisch rushing like that to the border is illegal and also, it wasn‚Äôt American police. It was Mexican riot police who stopped them.
Good
+Melody Tenisch well your a stupid dumbbitch !
+Melody Tenisch but rushing to over throw security is illegal
David Lutz Like a Monty Python attack: "CHARGE!........Oops........RUN AWAY!!!!!!"
+Crown royal Really? You're nasty.
+Lor M. Where are you from? Not America.
Do you morons know that going to the border is not illegal? Try reading the laws.
Lead next.. We need to get a point across.
Yeah go back to the Homeland
Keep them out them people coming from 3 or 4 different countries AMERICA already fool im a American NATIVE we don&#39;t want them.
+Athena SuperHeldin Those are South Americans aka Mayans,Aztecs.. They have always been indigenous to south america not North America. North American indians are apache Cherokee ect. Native americans arent just one groupd of people dipshit. North American natives are taller and have long straighter hair than short mayans.. You obliviously learned nothing in school
+Deon Johnson People bash Trump for valid reasons. Do you listen to what comes out of HIS mouth? Really? He's a criminal and come January you may see the start of investigations.
+Athena SuperHeldin Actually anybody born in America is technically "native" to it.
Just wat it sound like full blooded American you on here wana argue im paying attention wats going on in our country chill sweetheart ant no pressure.
+Deon Johnson WTF does full blooded american even mean? NEITHER TRUMP nor his children are full blood americans themselves!
+hevquip you are NOT a native. Stop misusing that word. YOUR parents or grandparents or greatgrandparents or ancestors were ALSO immigrants who came over to america to make their life better. ONLY THE INDIGENOUS PEOPLES ARE NATIVE. Stop your BS
I understand wat your saying thats correct. But you understand wat im trying to say im proud to be a full blooded American. All those people trying force themselves over here is a problem most definitely.
And as a white American native, I too don't want anymore foreign cultures invading this country that Americans have built up. And we should be fixing up the communities of our native black Americans before helping these people anyway. We need more native black Americans supporting that kind of nationalism.
Either way it goes people always bashing trump any were you go you got to behave an get a job an JUST live right if you doing right you will be blessed period
+Deon Johnson so NOT a native american...as in indigenous. Alright got you. I don't think it is smart to call yourself american native....kinda sounds like you are saying you were an ACTUAL american native...like tje indigenous people who have lived on the lands since like 10,000B.c. but okay. You do you, boo! Continue hating people who are trying to seek asylum when your ancestors themselves were also at some point FOREIGN!
im a full blooded black American NATIVE. I love America before long it will be a whole country of them people over here they coming from 3 or 4 different countries that's to many
LOL stop your lying. You are not a native american. If you actually were....all those european immigrants like Trump would have bothered you. Stop pretending to be a native american. Hahahahahahahaah

Shoot the invaders!
Well what a mess for U.S. vacationers. I guess Trump wants us all to stay at his hotels stateside. Oh wait we can&#39;t afford it.
Migrants are starving and this guys is worried about vacationers haha.... sounds like the common democrat
Do not vacation in Saudi Arabia, we wont help if you get dismembered. It's a vicious world
Oh poor vacationers. So sorry to have ruined everything for you.
Shawn Newell It‚Äôs not that the world knew they were coming. Stay away from danger and turmoil. Get out of arms way.
Seriously? Vacation. You‚Äôre showing how spoiled you are, you have privilege mentality.
I would not step foot in Mexico we do not eat their food you went to Mexico for vacation enjoy it stay there
Make Central America great again so these ppl can go back home..

Stephanie Parker Native Americans: ‚Äúmake Europe great again so these white people can go back home‚Äù Gotta love the irony in your comment
but who's gonna rake your forests to prevent fires?

With who's money?

Take the same approach turn around take the same approach towards your government pick up rocks sticks trees bumpers whatever you have to do and fight your government overthrow them have a revolution have y'all not heard that's how we got great my papa's Papa's and their Papa's fought and died
They need to go back home fight a revolution against the government RI assert their government and go forward their self and quit running to my country we already fought the revolution
Stephanie Parker the spanish/portuguese conquistadors need to come back to bring these savages civilization again.
Right answer!!!
My friends are stuck in TJ! And they are citizens this is a mess!
If she has legal and proper documentation she should have no trouble getting back to the US. If not than i do not know what to say. They knew what was going on at our borders.
Expedia says Honduras is really nice..
hevquip you clearly aren't from San Diego. People live between both cities regularly. But they were there for the sin bandera concert.
Janaye Faafiti Honestly, this isn‚Äôt that big of a surprise. I‚Äôm sure the possibility of a closing had crossed her mind. If she‚Äôs stuck in Mexico, it‚Äôs her own fault.
+Janaye Faafiti It's the intruders fault. Who gave them the idea that they can just walk into our country without invitation.
Blame these outlaws who think they have the right to enter our country with permission.
You deserve to b stuck there if you couldn't see this clash coming
Tell them they're idiots for going to Mexico during times like this. I bet they went for a dumb reason too.
Janaye Faafiti REMBER the FIRES few weeks ago couldnt drive for days
Anchor babies . Tell them to stay in Mexico
same here, I have a friend who is a U.S. citizen and she goes to rosarito every weekend because she has her home/family there but idk how shes going to come home tonight :(
What was wrong with Hawaii couldn't afford it
Tell them to try for another border crossing. Get in contact with the US consulate.
Tell them to drive east to Mexicali and cross there

Democrats do not support or condone migrants rushing the border. We do support following US and international immigration law, meaning the US needs to honor its obligation, by law, to let migrants petition for asylum.
Illegal immigrants should not cross. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23nomore">#nomore</a>
Arlin Tso What is this the ‚ùÑÔ∏è discussion. If you don‚Äôt like it you could always go back to Europe. Oh no wait you can‚Äôt. Guess you‚Äôll just have to suck it up üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Arlin Tso Gotta catch em all cause he is..?????
Mexican government let them in. Gave them shelter medical aid and even got vast majority registered. Whatsoever there's no excuse for what they done today..
+Martinez Ana by UN law they are supposed to apply for asylum in the first country they enter in this case Mexico. They refused. So the US is allowed to not let them in.
+Christopher Stevens Its not yoyr damn country, you stole it from the native americans and now you wont allow others. This is beyond hypocricey.
Lynette Scribner That‚Äôs a lie! USA have the most FAT and OBESE people on the planet. You should share your food with the poor. Then maybe the obese percentage in the US wouldn‚Äôt be so high. People in USA weigh triple the amount of one person from any other countryüíÅüèΩ
Christopher Stevens It''s not an invasion. They are refugees who by order of law, must be in the US to apply for refugee status. Read the laws! An invasion wouldn't happen at a legal port of entry.
+Martinez Ana ofcourse the US CAN CLOSE THE BORDER! With thousands trying to come across it's a state of emergency! CNN & the rest saying the caravan was just the rights imagination! Lol! Clearly it wasnt just their imagination!
+Eduardo Ap They broke through the Mexican-Guatemalan border.... illegally.
Arlin Tso that's a legal port of entry meaning. The US literally cannot close the point in which you can enter legally.
Well technically they have to cross to be consider "illegal"
+YYZpresto üòÇ
+Lynette Scribner üòÇ
Do not stall, deport them all!
Arlin Tso None of them should cross! You allow 1 and they come in droves and keep having more and more kids. We can barely feed our own! I am happy with diversity in our country. But NOT with being overrun!

Yes he is...haven't you noticed? The Invaders are south of the border.

+Dan O'Connor hi Dan, thanks. I live in the beach area of Tijuana and this is where the eye of the storm is. I believe that they're in my city because we're so close to the beach. They probably think that they will be able to cross via the ocean. Mexican media is mixed. Some are empathic of them while other outlets are saying what the majority of the people from my city are saying: we can't handle them any longer. It's pretty bad. A lot of Mexicans go to San Diego, (like me) on the weekends to shop but I'm way in the western part- like I said before, there's no way that I'm going to drive east to cross via the Otay border. I'm blaming the federal government. If my countrymen disagree with me- sorry. How can the military at our southern border let this happen? So now they are here- and I'm literally seeing BABIES laying on the beach. I mean IT'S A TOTAL DISASTER.

it cost more for security then to just let 3,000 people in.
I would gladly pay more taxes to build a wall and fill it with snipers. If we need more money we can cut off welfare.
Video Archives yea in long run it will cost u and me thousands in tax to support these ppl. Sorry lets put are life jackets on first and then we can help other people in other countries
Video Archives We don't want them. We have our own who aren't getting all their needs met, who are homeless.
What about the 35 million illegals here already?
3,000....MORE LIKE 20,000 6,000 AT border now plus 2,700 ALREADY THERE TRY LEGALLY YO ENTER why should they go ahead of themüò°8,000 more in Mexico City coming this way carjackings raping kiddnapping..plus. More behind them and more ...you have room in your house
Uh, just 3k? Y‚Äôall are so uninformed and oblivious. It‚Äôs more than concept. It‚Äôs respect and honor towards what we have been blessed with since some sane God fearing people who unanimously agreed, put in writing what will and will not be tolerated.
If you let team in more millions people will try to come in.
Thousand people that are coming in and you want to support them you want to pay their health insurance. Maybe you should move to Mexico
+NaMiYummy and school...and school lunches... transportation.... doctors....medications...etc. Basically they need everything...especially children.....we need to pay for every need they have until they are old enough to work...and then of course....they don't want to work...they want college...for free...smh So each child needs all their needs paid for for around 16 years before they get their first paycheck and pay their first dime in taxes. It's an astronomical amount of money for even one child.
Not 3000 more like over 7000. You let them in, more people will come.
Not at all.....only a simpleton would even consider saying such a thing. Smh
You must be a stupid liberal

title	Turns Out THIS Is The Super Bowl Ad Right Wingers Hate
description	"Every year, there's always one Super Bowl ad that generates a bit of next-day controversy. And this year's ad appears to be Coca-Cola's "It's Beautiful" ad. The one-minute ad features children and adults from all walks of life, from across the country, singing "America the Beautiful" in multiple languages. Seems fairly straight-forward, right? Not like the infamous Bar Refaeli Go Daddy ad from last year that featured the Israeli supermodel making out with a nerd. However, two aspects of the ad appear to have turned it into one of those cultural hot spots (or at least a lukewarm spot) that ignites a little social media outrage for awhile. Some objected to the idea of hearing "America the Beautiful" sung in languages that were not English. Others objected to the inclusion of two gay dads in the ad."* The Young Turks hosts Cenk Uygur and Ana Kasparian break it down. *Read more here from Patrick Kevin Day / LA Times: http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/showtracker/la-et-st-coca-cola-super-bowl-ad-stirs-controversy-20140203,0,1361331.story ********** Turns Out THIS Is The Super Bowl Ad Right Wingers Hate https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_CSaEtKtw0 Could Legalization Have Saved Philip Seymour Hoffman? http://bit.ly/1doL69P The REAL Cause Of Philip Seymour Hoffman's Death...According To One Conservative Jackbag http://bit.ly/1iphnmt Woody Allen Molestation Allegations http://bit.ly/1aoa0vd ********** The Largest Online News Show in the World.

We are not afraid to talk about politics and entertainment and sports and pop culture. But that is not the revolution either. The real revolution is in daring to be honest with people. We don't patronize our viewers or lie to them. We have real conversations and deliver the news honestly.

And the fact that america has no base language or culture. That&#39;s what it was founded for, for freedom of expression. And why should they learn english if they don&#39;t want to, or forget their culture? Just because they are currently in america doesn&#39;t mean they live here. If I go to france for a couple weeks, I&#39;m not gonna change my culture, I might not even learn any french, just hire a translator or something. (I kinda stopped talking about the video half way through my rant...)	UCR9V8uon4_Zlv57n-9ISweQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR9V8uon4_Zlv57n-9ISweQ	0

They think of America as a white male Christian nation. They must be living in the dark ages, in their minds. But, then, they seem to forget who was on this Continent first. That&#39;s right, natives, aka, native Americans. That actually sounds include Mexicans, as they once we&#39;re proud owners of California, Oregon, half of Washington, Nevada, New Mexico (ironic how a state called New Mexico is full racist assholes who hate Mexicans), Texas (properly spelled Tejas and properly pronounced TƒÅ h√§s), Utah, Arizona and,I think, part of Montana.

Also, I coke isn&#39;t just in America. Yes the song was American but still ... jeez get over yourself.<br /><br />However. Both sets of my grandparents were immigrants (Italy and Sweden on my mom - Polish and Irish on my dad). They all came here and they all learned and spoke English.<br /><br />Did they continue to speak Italian, Gaelic, Swedish, and Polish at home - yes. But they also knew English as they now considered America &#39;their&#39; country. Many immigrants now do NOT consider America their country. They also send much of their money back to their country - something which affects the economy.<br /><br />Do I have a problem with people speaking other languages? No. But I do have problems when there are jobs that only cater to people who speak languages other than English. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s fair. Jobs are hard enough to come by.

The poem was an attempt to influence America to see itself as a safe refuge for immigrants. We know who promoted this idea and why.

Only an ignoramus moron would think that people singing a song together trading verses in their own various cultural languages would be a message of any kind of divide. By singing in their native cultural languages they were sharing the message of &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; itself demonstrating if anything - a solidarity with their English-speaking fellow Americans. Would an American singing the national anthem of Mexico or about the beauty and majesty of Mexico in English be dishonoring Mexico or its people?<br /><br />BTW: &quot;America the Beautiful&#39;s&quot; melody was written by Samuel A. Ward but lyrics were composed by Katherine Lee Bates as a poem inspired by the view from Pike&#39;s Peak, Colorado. <br /><br />Bates was a lesbian who very much believed in the coming together, merger, and unity of differing cultures. Bates was very pro-League of Nations advocate for international unity.	UC7_WnXcF87Xke_37ho2rlIA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7_WnXcF87Xke_37ho2rlIA	0

I believe people should be required to learn English in the United States. I have had Mexicans in my family (who moved here) who learned English.

Look up terror attacks for the last 100 years and see who was responsible.

To me the whole principle of learning English if you want to live in America isn't something I'm a purist on. It's perfectly fine with me if people want to speak other languages or their native language. I'm just saying that the government, no matter how much some may not like it, has an identity to hold itself up to. A part of that identity is embracing the values of its people. If one of those aspects would be that people speak English, then they should act accordingly. I would be just as strong on that stance if I lived in Mexico, France, or Vietnam.

For someone who might not be 100% fluent in English, I think you'd agree that you'd want them to be able to do their taxes correctly as well.

Because this is a tyt video i would like to state that i am a Democrat, however i do agree with some proposed polices held by republicans of previous presidencies. i was too young to vote the last time this occured, which saddens me. republicans used to have bright, candidates that for better or worse cared for it&#39;s people. while i admit things like this did happen, i don&#39;t recall such hatred, and intensity. of this im sure im going to get educated by one or two things and then just repetition. thanks for reading my opinion.

You&#39;re excessive attention and emotional treatment of this &quot;problem&quot; is the real problem. Not to mention, that TYT assumes the moral high ground. Cenk? Are you the pope? Is Ana a Cardinal of the church?<br /><br />You have limited compassion.

Two hundred years ago, there were slaves, Blacks didn&#39;t have rights, and every person under the sun that wasn&#39;t a white, protestant man was treated like shit.

We are, after all, &quot;The Great Melting Pot.&quot; I don&#39;t believe in illegal immigration, and I think all illegals should be punished for breaking the law. If someone comes to this country the legal way, though, WELCOME! I also think there should be a way to resolve &quot;oopses&quot; easily. Say, someone is a legal immigrant and their papers run out. Maybe they forgot to renew them - it can happen. They should be able to go to the DOI and be able to renew them without hassle or threat. In fact, if an illegal wants to become legal, there should be some means for that too. Now, if they don&#39;t really care, they should be thrown out of the country. As far as I am concerned, this is a great commercial and should be played more often. It shows what the true USA is all about!

Also because my Dad was multi-lingual. Communication at it's best is wonderful, though, cautiously, sometimes it is fraught with misinterpretation and triggers defence mechanisms needlessly deployed. I have found that exactitude can be seen as aggression in print, when it is merely a style of speaking. The same as 'received' English is taken to be an attempt at portraying authority at it's worst, but having a fifty percent deaf mother, to her, only meant clarity. So, also, having a Germanic father means I may sound snobbish, arrogant. What it really means is I speak clearly and probably have speech patterns that sound arrogant and that bleeds into my writing. We all have, I think, a default style, not of our own making, which is irrespective of our characters and not always that which we wish to portray and that doesn't always help us communicate precisely in the way that we wish. My usual long-winded way of praying forgiveness for any upset.	UC0daaNxrwA4ok8gAZPM1A2g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0daaNxrwA4ok8gAZPM1A2g	1	Ugjm46HuUd1cQngCoAEC	Anslem Slove

If you look at Brazil as an example which is one of the most racially diverse nations in the world. Do you think the people down there call themselves anything else but Brazilian?

In fact, since we defeated the fascist Nazi and tyrannical Japanese regimes in World War II, the United States has accepted more of the &quot;tire, the poor and the hungry&quot; from every other country/culture in the entire world than has any other country/culture in the entire world! &quot;From Many comes One,&quot; and we&#39;re expected to assimilate into the ONE, unless those of us who flock to the shores of the United States really don&#39;t want to assimilate, and then liberalism will encourage them to cultivate their own Hate America Culture, like the muslims have for the past 2,000 years. Of course, unlike Cuba and other leftist run countries, those who wish to leave the Unites States are not considered &quot;escaping,&quot; but simply using their own free will to leave! <br /><br />Just as various European cultures have historically fought, defeated and enslaved their &quot;enemies,&quot; various &quot;Indian&quot; tribes in the Americas have done the same throughout history. Are liberal minded people too stupid to realize that is how &quot;Indian Nations&quot; were created, with one tribe conquering another tribe and stealing the grazing land, the water and other resources of the defeated tribe, and then enslaving the survivors of the conquered tribe? Just as African tribes sought to gain more control of their surroundings, defeating and enslaving the survivors of the conquered tribe. That&#39;s the history of the Human race, as well as all other animals... the taking of another&#39;s property for their own use. The difference is that liberals in the United States are using the tool of &quot;government&quot; regulations to steal other people&#39;s property, like the Nazis and the Communist and any other tyrannical dictators have done throughout history. First, take away the weapons of the people so that they cannot defend themselves, then enslave the people...<br /><br />I can&#39;t change my &quot;White&quot; color any more than a Black American can change his/her &quot;color,&quot; or a &quot;Red&quot; or &quot;Yellow&quot; person can change the pigmentation of their skin. Based on my genealogy, my heritage and racist oriented liberal language, I&#39;m an African-American, Black-Irish, Polish-Jew, &quot;Cracker.&quot; But in reality I am nothing more than a &quot;mutt,&quot; just like most every person in America today, whose ancestors assimilated with the American culture soon after they arrived on these shores in the 1880s and the 1950s. <br /><br />Unlike the whinny &quot;TYT&quot; malcontents in the video, who must be experiencing success in their professional lives but not in their personal lives, it&#39;s always someone else&#39;s fault that life is &quot;unfair&quot; for the &quot;masses.&quot; These morons are never happy, except when they are complaining about how &quot;unfair&quot; life might be for people who don&#39;t have enough personal sense and/or motivation to pick themselves up and contribute to their own personal growth... If you&#39;re not a liberal in your teens and twenties you have no heart, if you&#39;re not conservative by the time you reach your thirties and forties you have no brain! Maybe there is still hope for those young, inexperienced and immature idiots in the video...	UCc0FXitVUNmJFH8fV3NtuXw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc0FXitVUNmJFH8fV3NtuXw	0

Pretty much the whole country did. But when Bush decided to go after Iraq we went tentatively along with it even though it felt wrong because Bush swore on a stack of bourbon soaked bibles that it was the right thing to do.

"Plus, it seemed that New Yorks cultural diversity still managed to create messy politics as the Islamic community became targeted as information spread of certain high ranking members supporting pseudo-terroristic/fundamentalist" So what you're saying is that all the other races unified against Muslims in a culturally and racially diverse city? Not true actually because within any community, culturally or racially diverse or not, you have a diversity of attitudes relating to the blame game among others. Diversity will always exist. If there are no muslims its the blacks. Remove the blacks and its the hispanics. Subtract the hispanics and its the polish, germans, jews, etc. And then you get to where all you have is the Irish. And then it becomes northern Irish vs southern. Neighbor against neighbor. I think there's a bible verse about that. Your argument about how beautiful a country of one culture is, is a pipe dream.

I like being able to find my car in a parking lot because my choices differ from others. What color, what part of the lot. Race and culture are important to each other.

So the people, (you for example), screaming to rid the country of other races, (not all other races mind you...just the ones you've convinced yourself are "other" races), are not the ones dividing the country? Your argument is that demanding the country be divided isn't dividing the country? Again...Moron. "However, what i am against is pandering to them at the cost of the public. Whether this means funding them or tapping into public services for their events." So you would be against the city closing off a street for an Oktoberfest style party? Or a St Patty's Day Parade? Or erecting a nativity scene for Christmas? But I enjoy those things. I don't think its pandering to acknowledge that the culture I was raised in is not the only culture. Hell...Two members of the same race have diversity to each other. Diversity will exist no matter what you do. "¬†i dont beleive in dictatorship. The furthest i could go is constitutional monarchy.

Multiculturalism provides the logs, anti immigrant or any other resentment lights the fire." And then in this post you say this: "division in society is the fault of liberals" You cannot blame people who are against divisiveness for the actions of those who would divide. Its not the existence of police that is responsible for crime. Its not the people screaming, don't rape her", who are responsible for the rape.

Either Cenk where miswording himself, as stated in my first post, or he is excluding whites. Words used was: First of all, a growing part of the country and soon that will be a majority of the country will be multicultural and not just white. This is why I added the how you use words part, cause this can easily exclude whites from the equation. Infact the sentence should have been the country is multicultural, the way he worded himself is nonsense tbh. Now I had to rewatch this crap just to answer a person that was too lazzy to watch it himself.

Most of my friends are non-whites, and from cultures I did not grow up in. The U.S. us described as a melting pot, though the reality is more like a salad bowl. The haters talking about this ad seem to be against the very idea that we should welcome anyone different from us. As far as learning English, it is the foreign language. If you want a native language, it should be Navajoe, Cherokee or one of the many other native American languages spoken before the arrival of Europeans. I don&#39;t know those languages, but I would not mind learning. If you want to know the value of the Navajoe, search &quot;code talkers&quot; on google. We don&#39;t give Native Americans enough credit for their contributions.	UCK1uzV0ln7yjo8wK2GLpzuQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK1uzV0ln7yjo8wK2GLpzuQ	0

Or directly benefit from one or more of the previously listed races destruction of the natives to steal the land.. There is nothing dumb about his comment, the Europeans (Spanish are Europeans) came to the previously discovered Americas, Canada, Australia, Africa, Many Islands, ect.. And raped, killed, diseased, enslaved, stole resources, used children for sex slavery, created un just laws, land grabbed, changed ancient boarders, created intentional conflict, gave exorbant loans to leaders they knew would not be able to pay back so that they could extract resources instead of payment, created wicked corrupt legal systems, used trickery, deceit and every wicked way imaginable and not imaginable to take what simply was not theirs.

Yes, if the purpose was¬†merely to defend the United States, yes. But, and this is a controversial point in American politics, the purpose is more to provide stability in the entire world. The entire world is a safer place with the United States as the only global superpower. Throughout history, other nations and empires have played that role. But, after two disastrous world wars, the general consensus has been that it is better for America to fulfill that role. Am I saying that America has done that perfectly? No. Am I saying that America has never been selfish in fulfilling that role? Of course not. What I am saying is that in that role we have been more benevolent that any other power in a similar role and more so than any other power who would inevitably take our place. What other nation would do a better job as a global superpower? Russia? China? Even the British Empire was more disastrous for the world. (Remember that WWI thing, and that Treaty of Versailles? Yeah, didn't end well, huh?) Anyway, please reflect on what I said. I know it is hard to explain in a YouTube comment. Peace.

Both the spanish and english languages came from Europe. So if you think your paying homage to continental natives ... think again. Shall we revisit the numbers killed and subjugated under all Europeans to give context for this point of language?<br /><br />What language is Mexico&#39;s national anthem sung in?

There is a very valuable and important point in saying that we cannot expand cultural flexibility overnight nor infinitely. The US does have very basic essential principles, shared core values, that must be absorbed by all its citizens. But the song expresses the dream of what America stands for. A good example is separation of church and state, something which has nuances not easily seen immediately. And all Americans should be schooled in at least two languages, one of them English.

However, the value of even just a small increase in liberty really shines when we compare the poorest from the freest 25% against poorest from the lest free 25%.¬† In the freer economies their poor as classified as the bottom 10% of annul income collectors made about 11000 (about 2X that of the mean income from the more managed economies) per year compared to around 1200 per year for bottom 10% from the most regulated/ least free.nations.¬† This means the poor from the less regulated nations receive almost 10X the annual income as the poor from the more regulated nations.¬† (But you don&#39;t care do you.)<br /><br />Here are some exact numbers of the OECD countries comparing size of govenment vs growth:<br /><br />The following copied and precise<br /><br />Government spending as a percentage of GDP compared to growth rate<br />Gov =¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† growth =<br />less than 25%¬†¬†¬†¬† 6.6<br />25 -29¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† 4.7<br />30- 39¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† 3.8<br />40 - 49¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† 2.8<br />50 - 59¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† 2.0<br />&gt; 60¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† 1.6<br /><br />Liberal Policy is a sin against the poor. There is no bigger sin perpetrated against the poor immigrant than not requiring him to speak the language of success. In America that language was - is - and always will be English. Yes it is true that America will shortly grow to a multicultural, multilingual nation. But well before we reach the non reachable fantasy of the great and fair socialist society which is the liberal wet dream - a multicultural pluralistic society where English speaking white Christians are the inconsequential minority - we will first reach the reality exactly similar to the despotic third world counties all over the the globe where white English speaking Christian people are the minority there and now. By the time we grow to even a slightly larger % of non English speaking Americans (or people living within America&#39;s boarders) than presently do not speak proper English here and now = well than success in America even for those speaking perfect English will be near impossible, and we will ALL live under the totalitarian brutality the liberal has worked so long and hard to implement. But the useful idiots that helped enslave us all will not be rewarded by his despot Sheppard and he will not be spared the horror and brutality that will be ubiquitous. In fact the liberal and all the classes of victims he promotes will still be at the bottom of the social hierarchy but in the future this hierarchy will truly frozen not just frozen in false claims - and wealth distribution will be even more disparate - and the weak and down trodden in far greater misery and peril.

I am not saying that we aren&#39;t a country of many different people who wanted to have freedom but at the same time I do feel that when you would want to know English as well. I thought that the video was nice but I will say that if you or I went over to any other country you and or I would have to learn their language. I my self as a kid tried to learn Spanish but no matter how hard I tried¬† I could never learn it to save my life. I can&#39;t even understand it I may only know two or three words but that wouldn&#39;t get me anywhere, so I give it to those who can speak both languages. I believe that they made this AD to show all different people can enjoy Coke and All of US should work together as Americans and not against each other. If you want to get technical All of should not really be here. The reason why is the American Indians were here before all of our white ancestors settled here. We took someone&#39;s land and put them on a small asseveration and entrapped them. So when we say other people don&#39;t belong here we should look and say we shouldn&#39;t be here ether.

There was nothing here to immigrate to. They were colonists and a large portion were sent here by their governments to help the colonies grow. My family for example was sent her under contract by the Church of England and the Crown to build Church of England. America was nothing but vast wilderness and the reason the colonist were able to sweep the natives aside so easily was because the natives still lived in the freaking stone age. They hadn't even discovered the wheel for gods sake. They hadn't domesticated horses. Some even practiced cannibalism. So no not all Americans are immigrants. That's not to say immigrants didn't play a huge role in building this nation because they did. Though the immigrants of the 19th and 20th century were eager to assimilate into American culture and generally didn't come from areas people burned American flags and yell death to America. Most came with a marketable skill and were able to get gainful employment. They didn't come needing an anti rape course because rape is common place where they come from. And last and most importantly they came legally and the records at places like Ellis Island and other points of entry bear that out.

Those people don't realise, that unless they are native Americans, their families once immigrated to America. The USA were founded by immigrants. That's why you are "the nation of immigrants". To be against immigration goes against the very principal and reason, why your country exists. America has always been a place for a new beginning. The home of the brave and the land of the free. This stands for having the courage to start anew, to go on a new journey and to fight for and live the dream of freedom from oppression and prosecution from the place you came from. To think immigration is a bad thing, is to direcly go against the believes of your forefathers and the founders of the USA.

Look it up if you don&#39;t believe me, it&#39;s a google search away.¬†<br /><br />I agree to some extent though, however the fact that whites won&#39;t be the majroity population by 2040/2050 is extremely disturbing. If the same thing happened in any other country, their would be panic and investigations, instead democrats push for amnesty and keeping the border insecure.¬†<br /><br />However, this add is not suggesting anything wrong, in fact it&#39;s quite touching. Just giving some people the context of why it&#39;s a real issue, and not just &quot;right wingers being paranoid.	UC8uBoG3SVYr_jRXtG2E1zJw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8uBoG3SVYr_jRXtG2E1zJw	0

That's a terrible thing to lose, especially if you research racial genetics. Intelligence, attractiveness interracially, less criminal even when adjusted for the same economic background and area.¬† Not that i'm promoting whites as completely superior, they aren't for sure, but in some areas on the margin they are. Then again, it's marginal differences in every area but interracial attractiveness (and certain crime statistics)¬† Secondly, the reason for them not being the majority race is the disturbing part. The fact we'd let illegal immigrants flood into the country and take it over when the country has so much influence is legitimately apocalyptic.¬† The fact that whites are having less babies is also very disturbing, when there's no reason that we should be. It's not like we're living in Japan where we are worked to the point we don't have the time, and it's not like we live in China with population controls, and it's not like we don't have the resources, and it's not like we don't have the money.¬† It's a very alarming prospect, and the full extent of it is something anyone with an investment in America should want to know the answer to.¬† Then again, another factor causing it is inter-racial babies mostly not being considered white when they are 1/2 1/2. Which shouldn't be this way, but it is. If someone is white and black they're white and black. But w/e, the points still apply even when you consider mix races.¬†	UC8uBoG3SVYr_jRXtG2E1zJw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8uBoG3SVYr_jRXtG2E1zJw	1	UgiAlqDHZ5moR3gCoAEC	Elijah Wyatt

And yes people and cultures have the right to preserve their heritage not just everybody but also Caucasians... But only Caucasians are called racist when they want to speak out about it........ Think, learn why!<br />A holes Zionist propaganda always places a white woman and with a black man and gays, jews, and anything else other than what is known to work well and build a strong society; A strong family of individual ethnicity. The zionist fear that for us but look at what they do in their shit country home of thieves, bigots and racially pure, stolen land country.<br />The zionist jews run the media and push cultural agendas detrimental to all countries except their own.... Stop using their banks, use a credit union, stop supporting the jew controlled Hollywood propaganda crap, stop buying products advertises in all jew controlled television media and that is a 95% of it, stop voting for jews or jew shills into office. We are many and we vote with what little money we have left, use it before the jew bankers take the rest of it away. You can not wait for somebody in politics to do it for us as the jew money controls that aspect of out liberty also... Read the truth, learn, get mad and do something about it. One last thing stop using your hard earned money supporting jew owned sports as all that money they make from your empty gratification goes to more control of you and your children&#39;s future.

The Democratic Party was of course the party of the old south, George Wallace, Lester Maddox, etc. The Republican Party was founded to abolish slavery. I guess the TYT believe that a one-party system would be the ideal? I have two granddaughters who are half Egyptian, Two Nephews and a niece who are Korean, a Nephew who is Mongolian, a mother who is Jewish, Two nephews and two nieces who are half Mexican, an entire branch of my family which is Spanish, etc. etc..

No I don&#39;t think so, you fuckers RUINED their culture by taking away one of the most important parts about their culture. Their language, that was one of the most important. So when you say that all immigrants have to learn English within 5 years or leave. You&#39;re saying that you have to learn English with in 5 years? You already know English, The Mexican population is mostly native american still, and yet they have to learn English? You put them into boarding schools to learn English, fuck you American scum peaces of shit. I&#39;m so angry at you fuckers. Why? Because they act like they own this land, native americans knew for a fact that they didn&#39;t own this land, they had sacred areas for cultural reasons. But they never thought of land being theirs forever, because they knew they would all die eventually, not as a whole in Genocide which unfortunately happened regardless. I&#39;m done peace.

This is because for any person to succeed in America they must speak English = thank God and more frustration to all those that speak only something else.¬† For America to succeed as a sovereign nation on the world stage its citizens must speak English only.¬† But you lefties can&#39;t wait for America to fall from the number one spot - so its all good.¬† I hope you live long enough to see the hardship you dump on your children - children born into crushing debt and in a world where the super powers are despotic nations like China instead of the a world imperfectly but well shepherded by America as the only true super power.¬† What you are pushing for is a very dangerous and tyrannical world = once America is to weak to prevent it.¬† Obama is providing just a glimmer of what the world will one day look like without American might = ISIS - the caliphate - F U Iran - F U Russians in Crimea - F U China and North Korea and terrorism run amok.<br /><br />I will boycott coke.¬† I know you libs are stupid and bigoted enough to think that Republicans or conservatives see people through the prism of race like you do, but its just not true.¬† Very few right wingers care about ethnic background or melanin content = why they admire Alan West.¬† We just prefer Americans to be American which is not an ethnicity but it does involve a culture and a language and that language is English.¬† It would be better if those that live here become American.¬† Many of the best Americans are immigrants for they truly have the perspective to compare America against instead of compared to some leftest utopian fantasy.¬† The American dream is dying under the prodigious weight and massive restriction on free will imposed by more and more codified liberal law and less and less societal pressure to do the right thing = pay your own way - get a job - don&#39;t have babies that you can&#39;t support - don&#39;t do drugs or get intoxicated all the time - and women (not men = men should continue to be men) close your legs together and most importantly speak proper English.

And then gung ho patriots have the audacity to wave the American flag while spewing their racist, xenophobic, intolerant, ignorant and short-sighted vitriol.

Keep improving and lead the world. It can happen one day.	UCIqln1WQGkCMtYWiOKg9kCg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIqln1WQGkCMtYWiOKg9kCg	0

Coca-cola sells one shitty soda that I won&#39;t drink, however that company sells other products that are okay and this ad was beautiful. Way to go for the marketing folks - they knew how to appeal to everyone in our &quot;melting pot&quot;. The love of other cultures is something deep within most of us at birth and it is too bad we lose it through conditioning.

Slavery, as described in Scripture, was not kidnapping someone and forcing them to work as a slave. It was what we now call indentured servitude, where people voluntarily sold themselves to pay off a debt, take care of their family, or own land (aka serfs, in this usage). It has been common throughout history, and is not the same as what we call slavery today. Kidnapping someone was punishable by death, whether you'd sold them or they escaped in some fashion; see Exodus 21:16.¬†	UCgi562DqCkA4BevztFqbrNg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgi562DqCkA4BevztFqbrNg	1	Ugjgu0_moJ29B3gCoAEC	David DeRoche

It&#39;s not disturbing to look into what amazing diversity our free country can attract and how much everyone is proud to be American (or how proud they feel for trying to be an American in this country for 5 years unless they don&#39;t learn english. Also, how can they quote that the people the commercial didn&#39;t want to learn English or weren&#39;t in the process of learning? You can still learn a language and still speak your mother tongue. It&#39;s still part of who they are. They want to cherish how beautiful America is with celebrating and saying it in their own language. I guess it could symbolize that even though America is their new home, they are proud to come from what home they had and move to America which was probably a safe place for their family. Red Wingers just want to make everything official and everyone in one category. They want to keep English as a strict commercial requirment. They wanted to keep marriage something one straight way. (Lol straight) but now it can have diversity without shame. That is what is truly beautiful. Diversity without shame but with cherish.

If you want to be that technical about it, NORTH America is a continent, SOUTH America is a continent. There is no continent referred to as only America. On the other hand, it is more than common for the United States to be called just America. I get it, the teacher is a miserable dick, but come on.

I personally oppose Gay marriage and know that it is in direct opposition to God's [ Holy Bible ] will for mankind.

There is hope that in the next two decades most of the hardcore racists and xenophobic assholes with power will be 6' under with a marble slab at their head. Sadly, there are the up and comers who would sell their soul to these rich monsters for a bit of power and fame (e.g. Scott Walker); these creatures are even more vicious, as they try to impress their masters and get more money. Sadly, so few people have a passport because of the cost of travel. Most people are living hand to mouth, and will be in serious financial jeopardy if they become ill or have a small paycheck. The only travel most can afford is to work and home, a trip to the grocery store and to see family on high holidays. Even finding the money to fill the tank to travel a few hours for Christmas (or other major significant day) is difficult for many. I know many families who celebrate significant holidays on another day so people can work on the holiday to make a little more money. Oh, I forget how long this gets, as I usually see it on G+! Basically, people only see what is around them because we can't afford travel, just work, work, work, work and paying taxes that go to the wealthy, as they get paid at tax time and are paying negative taxes.

Beck and his crazy ilk are generally the charmless human face and mouthpieces of big business like Murdoch in his case/ political donors etc. &amp; Is¬†it more sinister that Coke is seeking to commodify and brand an emotional response to a sense of nationalistic pride? Anyone else find that kind of insidious and nauseating -they can&#39;t just put a neutral fact based idea into the mental marketplace ie. buy Coke it has these desirable properties but are annexing a psychological evolutionary hangover &amp; buying brand loyalty by association as well as trading on physiological addiction. They are entirely unprincipled beyond what is entailed in the commercial leverage of their brand identity &amp; ultimately a drive to increase revenues irrespective of harms to consumers/suppliers... just changed my mind, to effectively target consumers must be a barometer of genuine social change hence a legitimate target for comment. ¬†Also, I have been listening to far far too much Russell Brand.

Now, the national anthem is ALWAYS sung in Maori (a dead language that virtually no one speaks except those who teach it) and people are openly abused and branded as racists if they dare to sing the national anthem in English instead of Maori.<br /><br />So, yeah, while the criticism of the advert seems like ignorant intolerance, SOMETIMES it is the thin edge of the wedge.

The effect even works when swimming, although in a slightly different manner, for hunting and to evade predators (although, one Greenland shark did get a young bear...fuck you climate change!)

However, there is no law, mandate or legal decree with regards to a national language! In fact, a little over two-hundred years ago, when the subject was broached, a straw poll was taken. Based on the poll, had a national language been declared, German would also have been included!	UCYeJzwE7y41zKr9HfgRcH0Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYeJzwE7y41zKr9HfgRcH0Q	0

The very first European immigrants, the Scandinavians, made few waves and little is known of how many integrated into the native population. The people we consider to be the first immigrants were invaders of Hispanic origin, not white. Later immigrants, who fled religious persecution were WASPs and they considered themselves "white" in order to make a line between the native population and themselves. Later, people who were not WASPs were not considered white, like the Irish. The Irish by melanin expression are among the whitest, but as many who fled where catholic, they were not considered white until other people, such as Germans and Eastern Europeans arrived. German Catholics were tolerated only because they came with money to invest and still believed in the Christian Abrahamic God. Some people now considered white, were not considered so until the 20th century!!! This does not mean that they were not differentiated from people of the African diaspora, but they did not have the same freedoms as "white people". We all know that the African American diaspora has made some of the greatest impacts upon the culture in this nation, and due to the tragedy of family and culture lost through the vile era of slavery, the diaspora has formed some of the most organic aspects of our national culture. While there is the true culture of this land, which is the original native culture which the European invaders and current GOP seek to eliminate, the next aspect of this land that grew organically from the experience on this soil is that of Africans who were forced out of necessity to form new cultural traditions and language. One could be sold to a plantation that had no speakers of one's language or knowledge of one's culture (hell, they didn't even know that one's yam wasn't the same as what they called a yam, because one's new peers had been there learning what grew here for some time.) Thus the people used what they could glean for the land to form a new culture, from bits of many tribes, both African and Native, and of their many captors along the way. These new ways became American Culture. The banjo we consider to be American, of the south and the mountains, is of African minstrel origin. So all those country music enthusiasts who love their finger pickin' banjo (and are also such proud racist 'Murricans), are really celebrating African influence on American culture. They also love plaid...which is of Irish (not considered white originally), Indian and African origin. America is a melting pot, because all of our cultured are blended to the point where extracting which elements come from which original culture is very difficult. Like separating the elements that compose steel. Those racist f@cks don't realize that their steel core is a mix of all immigrant cultures, not this label "white" which means nothing.

Part of the crew she worked with knew both Spanish and English. A man was in line and began out loud speaking in Spanish something derogatory about my wife who was waiting on him. One of the tech&#39;s who spoke Spanish told my wife what he was saying about her. She handled him professionally, but I, of coarse being her husband, wanted my wife to show me who he was so I could convey to him how chicken excrement it is to use any language that you assume someone else doesn&#39;t know in order to say something lewd straight to their face or in close proximity ear shot. George Lopez did a bit acknowledging white people in the audience on how glad he was that they were there, and then in Spanish started calling them all sorts of undermining things. In that case, the white folk knew what he was doing (and a lot knew exactly what he was saying), so in that situation it was funny. You are on George&#39;s turf, even paid to be there, so brace yourself. In my wife&#39;s situation, not so funny.	UCYDn-SUnzj-vqaYSXHLTMRw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYDn-SUnzj-vqaYSXHLTMRw	0

Learning English in America intent is to have a common language we can all communicate with each other by, and not about giving up the language of your heritage because America is anti-(insert race here). This video makes reference to the Statue of Liberty statement, which, the last time I checked, was written in English. If you are going to anywhere to live for the long term, in order to avoid being on a communication disadvantage, you better either be rich and pay an interpreter, or learn the dominant language used in that region. It&#39;s not about racism, it&#39;s about common sense. This video was also done in French? Yiddish? Nope; done in English.

In 2000 the presidential race helped shed light on something. 23)¬† If you are too stupid to understand how to vote, you‚Äôre a Democrat. 24)¬† I‚Äôm sure 24 is true but I can‚Äôt support it, so I‚Äôll call it conclusion; If your name is Donald Duck you are likely a Democrat.¬† Also zombies usually vote Democrat.

No wooden spoon abuse (lol!) but my parents didn't teach us Spanish, their native language, and used it as a "code language" to speak to each other, which made me hate the language. Now they regret this, as they should. I think you're wrong about how people "don't bother". They DO, it's just that when/if you hear them speaking their language to each other, you assume they don't also speak English. Some lady from the midwest I met once said she had never even HEARD anyone speak a foreign language at the grocery store until she moved here to CA. That's telling, albeit anecdotal....How many people who oppose this commercial or its message live in similar situations, perhaps in red states? How many have been fed right-wing propaganda about "foreign invaders coming for our jobs"? OF COURSE people should learn to speak English! But language represents culture as well.

When this country was being built and we opened our borders to large amounts of immigrants we would then give that group time to assimilate into American culture before we opened them again. The immigrants were happy to become American and quickly integrated into society. My maternal Grandfathers family moved here in the 1920s from Germany and he talked about how his mother wood whack him with a wooden spoon if he spoke German in the house. When I asked him why he said because they weren't Germans anymore they were American. They were so proud of their new lives that they left their German roots behind. Now days they make no effort to assimilate and expect us to accommodate them. That's not how it works. Nobody cared that people of different races were in that commercial it was that they weren't speaking English which should be the first requirement for citizenship.

The kind that think they can win every argument & intellectualize racism/homophobia/misogyny/xenophobia because "free markets" is the answer to every social ill, including their own psychosis.

That's basically what you're both saying, not quite so succinctly.¬† ¬† The "liberal version of multiculturalism" IS multiculturalism. The conservative version is keeping America the way you THINK it is, WASPy and ethnic free.... As familiar as your last family reunion. If you look over some of "FiT PT's" hideously LONG comments, he goes into great detail on why he thinks allowing all these other cultures (including blacks) past our nice, clean, white picket fences "corrupts" the America he knows and loves. He's quite passionate and articulate in describing his racism. Like you, he claims to be the one engaging critical thinking rather than emotions. ¬† It's very entertaining actually, fucking with him... ¬† ¬†By all means, join the fray. I'm sure someone who defends something Glenn Beck has to say will have LOADS of logic and reason to add to this thread. (sarcasm) You said, "The "subtle" message of the AD was clear to those of us who pay attention to these things" ¬† ¬†It's not "paying attention". it's PARANOIA! The classic American conservative variety. And like I said before, you're right. You ARE an endangered species. Soon, WASPs (heavy emphasis on the P) will be the minority in America. With or without this commercial running 24/7, that is going to happen here. That's because America is made of immigrants. Even YOU and your ancestors are immigrants, unless by some chance they were indigenous Americans.... Didn't think so. ¬†White Americans seem to think the influx of these other cultures is a bad thing. That people are supposed to "conform" and Anglicize everything, including their names. Well, you're talking to someone who swallowed that LIE up until I was 25 (over 20 years ago now), and all because of fucking racism. My name sounds very Hispanic, and because I grew up in mostly white schools, hearing every kid in the class LAUGH when the teacher called role the first day FORCED me into Anglicizing it. That's not a virtue of America, it's a pathetic fucking WEAKNESS! ¬† ¬†Our strength comes from our diversity. That includes keeping the rich traditions of our various world cultures alive. I'll say it again to you, I AGREE...everyone needs to learn English who comes here. My dad did. He came from South America. Even my mom did, though her family are Tejano and thus, English was thrust upon them when Mexico was annexed. I don't have a problem with English being our national language.¬† None whatsoever. Remember that. "FiT PT" seems to keep forgetting though I've reminded him twice already... ¬†¬† What I have a problem with is the pigheaded ELITISM these RACIST, HOMOPHOBIC FUCKING FUNDIES engage in while pretending it's normal and even "patriotic" to do so. ¬†...Or as you call it, "the conservative version of multiculturalism".

TYT lies again.... ¬†West wasn't being critical of immigrants, he was being critical of turning an American Patriotic song into a world song in languages that is not the language of the country. ¬†While I can agree that he likely didn't need to spaz about the commercial, his point is still valid. ¬†When immigrants bring their ideology and values with them, don't conform to American ideology and values, then you are changing America. ¬†He was addressing a bigger issue in the culture, not necessarily attacking the commercial itself. FYI, "The South" isn't the Republican Party. ¬†Simply because the Democrat racist South is more Republican now, thus not all have gotten rid of all their racism, doesn't make them the Republican Party Values. ¬†Liberal revisionist history is amazing. ¬†You all want to ban the Confederate Flag for it's historical racism..... ¬†well, Democrats should be banned for YOUR historical racism. ¬†And further, blacks engage in more racism than whites today, and guess what most blacks are, Democrats.....! TYT also lies about Glenn Beck..... ¬†The "division" he speaks of is Liberals having the NEED to always talk about race, to celebrate race, it's always race race race with liberals, so that AD was in a sense just shoving it in peoples face. ¬†Conservatives aren't against Multiculturalism in its "traditional" meaning, we are against it in it's LIBERAL meaning and abuse thereof. See, what you liberals don't realize is that you look at things on the surface.... ¬†Conservatives, especially those who understand ideology, history, etc. see how media and corporations are brainwashing the culture into liberal ideology. ¬†Now, I can actually agree with TYT in that the criticism in this case was frankly unnecessary. ¬†However, the are in Politics, they address bigger issues, and that's what they were addressing with the ad. ¬†Now, they were likely being too¬†hyper political, but they have a point also. ¬†The commercial wasn't simply celebrating traditional wholesome multiculturalism, they were putting it into Politics. ¬†The "subtle" message of the AD was clear to those of us who pay attention to these things, having critical thinking skills unlike liberals to just see the "feeling" of the video. TYT also lies about the Tweet..... ¬†He was addressing the "subtext" of the AD, not actually claiming only illegals dring coke. ¬†While I agree his statement was essentially out of place, it also wasn't "racist". ¬†He again, was addressing the bigger issue. ¬†Liberals confuse traditional multiculturalism with THEIR multiculturalism, which is why TYT cannot even comprehend the points these conservatives were making. ¬†Liberals believe their multiculturalism is the wholesome we are the world kind, but it's not even close. ¬†Allowing illegals to radically change, take over, take jobs, abuse public services, etc. and be a huge voting block for a political party to gain and maintain power IS NOT multiculturalism in its pure sense. ¬†It's the liberal version. And that's another thing..... ¬†Glen Beck that you again quoted actually proves my point. ¬†He mentioned the Coke Commercial of the people of the world "Holding Hands" and singing.... ¬†Guess what, they were singing in English. ¬†They were Multicultural, but they were singing English. ¬†Contrast that with this song, which took an American Patriotic song and had people singing in different languages. ¬†So, they brought Politics into a Coke commercial, AND they promoted the liberal version of multiculturalism, where immigrants can be whatever they want, they don't have to assimilate. So, that fact entirely debunks the conservatives are racist claim by TYT.	UCcgV-EdIARRzo-MRSZjtEGw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcgV-EdIARRzo-MRSZjtEGw	1	UggkCQrlYCnEkHgCoAEC	Golgotha_Mythos69

But If emancipation and the 13th had to go also - I would CRY and throw up but keep all the shit we have rather than go there (even though emancipation and the 13th are also unconstitutional - the 13th is an odd example). In today's environment most of the CRA is duncil.¬† Unlike the delusional world of liberal projection - most contemporary Americans are not racist and would be delighted to serve any customer in a deregulated and free society.¬† In today's sociopolitical environment such selective service would be a FAR FAR greater liability to the business than the customer.¬† It would quickly root out TRUE racism not whatever twisted standard you or TYT use. The role back of Jim Crow needs to remain intact - but voter ID would improve things and is entirely proper and legal from any reasoned angle (in fact the lack of voter ID is improper).¬† What is your fucked up definition of racism - which includes me Alan West (?) and the Paul's? = People that do not accept your ideology are racist ????¬† The Pauls and myself will stand on the side of any political issue that supports liberty - liberty = the absence of FORCE.¬† The Pauls position on CRA one way or the other is not a function of racial convictions but convictions about liberty and the role of government.¬† Your example of racism isn't. Below is the effect on the poor strictly measured as the effect of FORCE over the freewill of free trade.¬† The more force imparted by government the worse things get for everybody but particularly the poor.¬† These are the facts - pretending they are not the facts doesn't help those in-suffered by liberal policy. CECD "the value of even just a small increase in liberty really shines when we compare the poorest from the freest 25% against poorest from the lest free 25%.¬† In the freer economies their poor made about 12000 per year in income (not that far below the mean from the more managed economies) compared to around 1200 per year for the most regulated/ least free.= poor receive about 10X the annual income as a result of less force over the economy = more liberty.¬† Concede that your remark about whites and Christians was bigoted and divisive.

Socialism and all socialist policy ALWAYS harms everybody except ¬†the despot FORCING IT - but it is particularly harmful to the poor.¬† The following all from memory - From the annual CECD report on the world's economies - The democratic nations rated in top 25% of economic liberty had a mean annual income or GDP per capita of about 39000 and the nations rated in the bottom 25% about 19000 = Economic liberty¬† resulted in 2X the mean wealth. Again this is not comparing the top 5% against the bottom 5% - it is the top 25% against bottom 25% according to some algorithm rating economic liberty. However, the value of even just a small increase in liberty really shines when we compare the poorest from the freest 25% against poorest from the lest free 25%.¬† In the freer economies their poor made about 12000 (not that far below the mean from the more managed economies) per year compared to around 1200 per year for the most regulated/ least free.= poor receive about 10X the annual wealth as a result of lower force and restriction or more liberty.¬† (But you don't care do you.)

I wrote an essay about freewill (almost all my new work is about freewill).¬† In it I contend that the only proper measure of a person is how he or she exercises their freewill.¬† This would make race a completely erroneous criteria on which to base character assessment. However my contention far exceeds race - even much more specific and diverse traits like talent, skill, and even intelligence are not a valid means to evaluate character.¬† Even beauty is not part of character.¬† The choice made to invest time for study or to perfect a skill would qualify. Obviously any person (me) that places such high (and proper) respect on freewill opposes anything that usurps or threatens liberty. Liberty simply defined is the absence of force.¬† Freewill is the choice and action made by competent adults in the absence of force.¬† Liberty and freewill are entirely co dependent (liberty is the sole virtue on which all others are erected). Modern liberalism is an extensive use of force over freewill - ergo I properly despise liberalism.¬† Liberal policy is an expression of freewill and a negative character trait.¬†	UCIdOk2-jZ23HJDdE3bTDX7Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIdOk2-jZ23HJDdE3bTDX7Q	1	UggkCQrlYCnEkHgCoAEC	Golgotha_Mythos69

I am going to attempt to teach you basic logical thinking (just like I tried to teach you basic statistics) - but I am sure you prefer to remain in your delusional world of hate - but I will shake your conviction. Before addressing logic it is better to address semantics. It is a fact that certain races have higher or lower incidence with respect to certain practices or aptitudes that are considered either good or bad or neither good nor bad.¬† Most aspects about life have both a genetic and environmental cause.¬† One can then speculate that some variations in behavior or ability etc. measured in the stats between races may be the result of some various percentage of genetic and environmental cause.¬† However, when it comes to race in America we can speculate that environment is the significantly larger cause of most meaningful variations. What is racism?¬† Racism is an interesting word with no widely accepted definition. However one agreed upon aspect about racism that basically translates across the board is - being called a racist is an insult, and being considered a racist is very bad. If such an accusation is false than a serious wrong has been done. Axiom one = an individual can not be held responsible for the actions of other people with similar skin tone or heritage including the actions of his parents.¬† A person doesn't inherit the crimes or bad acts of their parents just as he doesn't inherit their good acts. ¬† To acknowledge that their is in fact a measurable tendency categorized by race within the culture is a piss poor definition of racism. Axiom two = acknowledging the truth is not inherently racist no matter what the truth is determined to be. However despite dissimilar measurable tendencies - to perpetuate the practice of classifying people according to race is a pretty good definition of racism. Axiom Three = People should not be classified according to race.¬† Race is an improper and harmful way to consider an individual. To ascribe the measurable tendencies linked to race classification from statistics within a culture as translatable onto a specific individual is a very good definition of racism.¬† Axiom Four = race tendency doesn't translate to an individual. To ascribe the action of an individual as translating to his race is also racist.¬† Axiom Five = an Individual's tendency doesn't translate to race. To prematurely ascribe general tendencies measured to a race as the cause of certain behavior is also racism. Axiom Six = To jump to conclusions about events as being the result of the race of the actors involved is inappropriate.¬† Before ascribing racial motives to actions or events it should be fairly certain there are racial motives.¬† And if possible or practical the implications of race as related to an event should be handled as to reduce animus not incite animus. Much of the above would also translate to any group not just race - but we have already agreed that there is a difference between an ascribed status such as race vs achieved status such as membership to a religion. However there are tendencies that are so prevalent it would be stupid to pretend they do not matter.¬† For example the important differences between the genders and some of the violent predispositions of many segments of Islam are significant enough to deserve notice and be addressed.¬† One good way to determine if linkage to a group is bigoted or not is to ask the question is this linkage necessity or beneficial or is this linkage unnecessary and divisive. To refuse to call terrorist a terrorist because of fear of insulting people of the same religion is just plan stupid. LOGIC African lions are lethal predators. True 1) You should be very careful when potentially in contact with a lion. False 1) Every lion is out to kill you. Beverly Francis is a female body builder that transitioned from power lifting. False 1) All body builders are female 2) All body builders were previously power lifters. Likely 1) Power lifting may increase the chance of body building. Unlikely 1) Being female increases the chance of being a body builder True 1) A person can be female and be a power lifter or a body builder. ¬† Joe is a white devout Christian and also a racist. False 1) All racist are Christian. 2) All Christians are racist. True 1) A Christian can be racist or a racist can be Christian. A black men is approximately 9X as likely to commit a homicide than a white men. A murder non suicide was committed in a locked room and during the time when only 3 people (and no animals or aliens or other life) were present. In the room when the murder was taking place was - the victim + Joe the white racist Christian + Jamal the black man. True 1) either Joe or Jamal or both are murderers. Likely 1) Jamal is the murderer. Unlikely 1) Joe is the murderer. False 1) It is OK to assume that Jamal is guilty. 2) It is OK to label Jamal a murderer. True 1) It is OK to be on guard when Jamal is around. 2) It is OK to be on guard when Joe is around. 3) If neither Joe nor Jamal can be convicted they must be given the benefit of the doubt of innocence. If we discover that Jamal is the Murderer: False 1) It is OK to blame the murder on the fact he is black.¬† 2) It is OK to transpose Jamal's murderous way to the black population. If we discover the victim is a minority but do not know the identity of the murderer. True 1) Now we can no longer consider it more likely that Jamal is the murderer or certainly the chance that Jamal did not commit the murder is increased. If we determine Joe commuted the murder. True 1) Racist can commit murder. Likely 1) We still can not equate racism as the cause of the murder but the odds that it was a factor increased. False 1) It is OK to blame Christians and/or whites and transpose Joe's murderous actions to Christians or whites in general. Coke advertises their product with a political message tacitly endorsing multiculturalism and multilingualism.¬† Allen West and FIT PT and others voice opposition to the add.¬† But no one specifically raises or claims race as a reason for their opposition. False 1) It can be concluded that the reason that Allen West and/or FIT PT do not like the ad is due to racism.¬† This is blatantly absurd because Allen West is black and FIT PT has made the case over and over he opposes the liberal politics which the ad advances not the race of the actors. 2) The reason that Allen West and/or FIT PT do not like the ad is due to Christianity.¬† This is blatantly absurd because there is no religious component to the add.¬† This is even more absurd because their is no logical link between Christianity and any of the issues from the add such as language or race.¬† This is even more absurd relative to FIT PT because he is not a Christian. 3) The preponderance of the people that oppose the add do so because of their own race or their own religion.¬† 4) The preponderance of the people that oppose the add do so because of the race or the religion of the people/actors in the add.¬† True 1) To assign blame for opposition to the add on the race or religion of those opposing it is an example of divisive racism.

Axiom Four = race tendency doesn't translate to an individual's actions.¬† Just because their are measurable tendencies displayed in the stats about a race doesn't allow for such statistical tendency to be transcribed onto an individual as the cause of his action. Axiom Five = an Individual's tendency doesn't translate to race.¬† The acts of an individual or group of individuals including racist acts can not be ascribed to the broader race.¬† Individual action can not be properly considered a function of his race.

The USA is and always has been innately violent for sure.¬† There are many complex reasons for this.¬† It is certainly fallacious to say this is a consequence of Christianity.¬† However, one very clear reason for domestic intra-boarder violence can be laid right in the lap of the welfare state and the perpetuation of a never ending underclass (further perpetuated by the politics of the Coke advertisement).¬† We already reviewed the crime stats and that a black man is 9X as likely to commit gun violence as a white man even though far more whites own guns (this is completely a gang thing - which is completely a welfare thing - which is completely a liberal thing - which is completely a stupid thing).¬† I can't get you to see something so basic as to the inappropriateness of anti-Christian hate speech and reckless racist slander - why would I try to delve into the highly complex and varied sociopolitical causes of USA aggression.¬† Get over your Christian hate.¬† If I knew you were gay - or this matter was about homophobia - I would still not agree with anti-christian attacks plastered on the web¬† - but I would get it - and I would never have bothered to confront you.

Talk about straw manning. This was my very last paragraph to you: You know that there is some really awful stuff in the old testament and torah and Quran - however Christianity has gotten past most of it and I really can't recall racism in particular in the Bible (its probably in there but not like misogyny or homophobia).¬† And racism is never taught from the pulpit - in fact it is discouraged as undeserving of the Christ.¬† Maybe I should have been more specific since I am conversing with a simpleton.¬† I am quite aware (and I am sure you know that I am aware) that the Old testament and Torah pertain to the Israelite as the chosen people. ¬† I am not aware of passages that pertain specifically to other races and skin color as a proper measure of a person (but its probably in there).¬† However, certainly the Christian culture and practice is missionary to the core and much, time, good will, and effort is spent converting people of all race and melanin content to the faith some hold dear, feel is beneficial, and wish to share with ALL - get it ALL I am certainly more knowledgeable than most about most things including religion.¬† However, I am highly unqualified to present any proper argument for the good morality contained in the canon of the Abrahamic Faiths.¬† I would not desire to make such as argument even if I were properly knowledgeable about the Abrahamic texts. If you can not see claiming even parsed knowledge of nefarious motives of why some people oppose a CLEARLY political advertisement is improper - I can not help you.¬† I can inform you - atheist like myself that would like to see the end of ILLEGAL immigration, and the promotion of American unity such as can be bolstered via the English language - find such comments offensive.¬† Of course I am not Christian but I can speculate that they find such comments even much more offensive.¬† So I will give you the best possible benefit of doubt and - take it that you intended to attack specifically some racist (which undoubtedly some that oppose the commercial are) and are perfectly willing to resort to religious bigotry to denounce racial bigotry.¬† I also take it that you not could care less about the majority of non racists that are smeared with the the few actual racists and could care less if you offended non-racists.¬† So much for the presumption of innocents to a liberal fool.¬† Therefore you should have presented right up front that - it is not racist motive but any opposition to the advertisement which is deemed an evil sin deserving hateful attacks and not claim special incite into the motive of strangers - or maybe its just the state of being a Christian that makes one a good target for hate.

Modern Liberalism which is certainly a religion (but not worthy of codified protection as such - for many reasons not the least of which is it will not profess to be a religion) tends to be HIGHLY bigoted toward Christianity as the sole religion worthy of persecution = because it is in the doctrine.¬† However, there is also a growing antisemitism (Jewish kind) within liberal culture - here but ever more in liberalism over seas. Muslims tend to be bigoted toward Jews in particular but toward any other FAITH including wrong headed Muslims. Hinduism is a religion steeped in bigotry - but I can not state with confidence the current state of Hinduism good or bad. Christians and and portions of practicing Jews tend to be the most tolerant of not only other religions but tolerant in general. The white race is less bigoted toward blacks than blacks toward whites.¬† In modern society the majority may have less reason to acquire racist sentiment - but the anti-white sentiment of minorities is not only excused by liberal idiots but encouraged and nurtured by liberal despots.¬† The liberal despot with the help of his army of useful idiots also acts to incite white racism toward minorities through policy such as redistribution, affirmative action, and constant race baiting propaganda. Singling out just white Christians to smear with insults of racist (and homophobia which had nothing to do with the ad - if I remember correctly ) is not only inaccurate but also harmful.¬† For example I have seen studies that conclude whites are less likely to be homophobic than other races - also women tend to be treated better in white culture and American culture than any other.¬† For example in Europe male infidelity is far from a vice its a character trait of respected men. Call a spade a spade - if you can point to or link a religion to racist or bigoted teachings and practices than call out the act or the specific actor.¬† If it is pervasive and condoned than maybe you could properly paint with a broad brush - but to single out just one FAITH and one race which tends to behave better and more tolerant than most is the very definition of bigotry.¬† DON'T DO IT!!

It is not and I am evidence that it is not.¬† You continue to call me racist with no good reason other than possibly the fallacious reason of your initial claim.¬† Such irresponsible accusations are very harmful in many ways but particularly by the diminution of the definition of true racism. You compounded this bad conclusion by also claiming that racism was a Christian vice.¬† There are surely Christians that are racist just as we see racism in almost any large group - of course in America racism was not only well suppressed but in steady decline before the election of the most racially and entirely divisive President in USA history.¬† Racism would be all but extinct here if not for liberal race baiters and demagogues doing everything possible to divide people and foster animus - this has certainly worked like a charm on you.¬† However, most Christians are not racist and smearing those good people because some other people that profess membership to the Christian faith are racist is worse than inappropriate it is bigotry and divisive.¬† I could properly accuse Christians as being irrational despite the fact that some are quite rational (of course irrational compared to what - certainly not a modern liberal).¬† This is because Christianity teaches irrationality as part of its fundamental doctrine.¬† However, racism is not preached by Christianity.¬† There is little if any racism at all in the cannon (I can't quote a racist passage) - and there is not any racism coming from the pulpit - not true right wing pulpits - maybe from Rev Wright and black liberation theology - which is just fine with liberals.¬† At least if you were to accuse Christianity of practicing misogyny you would be largely inaccurate but a reasoned argument could be made for such an accusation.¬† It is clear that you are the bigot and its the religion of modern liberalism that preaches hate and bigotry not the preponderance of Christians, Objectivists, Libertarians, or me.

It is amazing how good liberals are at pulling the wool over their own eyes. Author Grossu (Washington Times) continues: ‚ÄúIn a letter to Clarence Gable in 1939, Sanger wrote: ‚ÄòWe do not want word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population, and the minister is the man who can straighten out that idea if it ever occurs to any of their more rebellious members.‚Äô (Margaret Sanger commenting on the ‚ÄòNegro Project‚Äô in a letter to Gamble, Dec. 10, 1939).‚Äù And then Grossu comments: ‚Äú79 percent of Planned Parenthood‚Äôs surgical abortion facilities are located within walking distance of black or Hispanic communities.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention‚Äôs Abortion Surveillance report revealed that between 2007 and 2010, nearly 36 percent of all abortions in the United States were performed on black children, even though black Americans make up only 13 percent of our population.‚Äù Margaret Sanger was a leader in the American eugenics movement. Some have argued that her comments about wanting to exterminate the black population were misconstrued: Sanger was actually saying she didn‚Äôt want people to get the wrong idea and think she was advocating genocide. On the other hand, Sanger wrote, in her famous 1912 essay, ‚ÄúWhat Every Girl Should Know‚Äù: ‚ÄúIn all fish and reptiles where there is no great brain development, there is also no conscious sexual control. The lower down in the scale of human development we go the less sexual control we find. It is said that the aboriginal Australian, the lowest known species of the human family, just a step higher than the chimpanzee in brain development, has so little sexual control that police authority alone prevents him from obtaining sexual satisfaction on the streets.‚Äù Sanger also wrote this: ‚ÄúBirth control is not contraception indiscriminately and thoughtlessly practiced. It means the release and cultivation of the better racial elements in our society, and the gradual suppression, elimination and eventual extirpation of defective stocks‚Äîthose human weeds which threaten the blooming of the finest flowers of American civilization.‚Äù If you answer this post with anything other than total acquiescence = you would than epitomize the shameless liberal idiot similar to Golgotha_Mythos69.

Hubert and Martin Luther King Jr. She never proposed or supported reducing the black population. She was appalled at the dangers and overuse of abortion, considered it a last resort and was a proponent of family planning and contraceptives as birth control. Sanger favored making birth control most available to those who could least afford children and was associated with a branch of eugenics. This has been perverted inside the conservative bubble into the crap you've cut and pasted and repeated so many times that the gullible (you) think it's true. If Sanger were the person you say, she would have been a hero of the right in her day and still would be. Michelle Bachmann (spelled with 2 'n's) is a former liberal democrat and a nutcase no conservative wants to be associated with. She is also alive. Sanger died in 1966. Where were you in 1966?

You're still here posting - blissfully unaware of how glaringly obvious the bigotry, hate, and stupidity from indoctrination into liberal group think is shinning right through each post.¬† Apparently simpletons (there are far to many of you) are easily seduced by the sophistry of despots, and simpletons with the numeric skill of an 8 year old see just what they wish to see (coincidentally what the liberal demagogue wishes you to see) in statistics.¬† Your debating prowess is no better than you mathematical ability.¬† Faux news loves gawd!!¬† Faux and gawd bad - government goooood!!¬† This is akin to some bazaar religious or cult mantra. I did not connect to your other links as yet (maybe I will) because I do not feel like explaining each one to an arrogant simpleton. I momentarily ascribed some small hope for you when you moved against the leftest doctrine on Islam = the religious enemy of my evil Christian enemy is my friend.¬† However you proved on mass as bigoted, hateful, intellectually challenged, and steeped in liberal dogma as your initial post would indicate. 1) I am atheist not a Christian. I want God out of the pledge and creative design out of science and biology classrooms.¬† 2) I am a libertarian not a right wing Republican.¬† I am a conservative as defined as desirous of conserving the Constitution and those portions of American culture and tradition that are worthy of conserving - not slavery, racism, homophobia, or bigotry of any configuration - but July 4th, Thanksgiving, the English language, and much of our factual American Christian ethic including Christmas -¬† also respect and deference for woman and good moms as deserving of such just for graciously enriching all of our lives for being women - and not forcing them to compete against or FUNDAMENTALLY transform into men.¬† The liberal fool erases the single greatest gift from nature's providence (the difference between the genders) with their insane anti-science - religious stupidity. (I could easily and will write a social and medical book on the liberal anti-science gender doctrine which is causing severe psychiatric and medical health issues for little girls = I really need liberals to stop helping girls and my daughter.)¬† 3) I am a Constitutionalists that defends the entire Bill of Rights not just the portions expedient to right (2, 9, 10) or leftwing (4, 5, 6) agenda. However, the libs and Obama have done the most damage by FAR to not only the Constitution, and Bill of Rights as a whole, but also to the 1st Amendment which they falsely claim to support. 4) I am for both capital punishment and legalization of drugs - at a minimum cannabis and cocaine - which would go a long way to emptying our RACIST prisons.¬† I would prefer the recreational pot smoker support himself in the market place not rot in prison subsidized with my tax dollars.¬† The legal system (government responsibility) not the healthcare system (private sector responsibility) is the segment of the society that required an overhaul.¬† Healthcare should have been left alone from the start. 5) I am pro choice but can easily see that there is NO Constitutional protection for abortion rights, and Roe vs Wade epitomizes the very harmful practice of judicial activism. 6) I could go on - but I will just sum up - Intelligent people (a group which will never include you) can easily see that one national language unifies all Americans and people of all ethnic background.¬† It gives the liberal despot one less tool to further promulgate his goal of division - it encourages non English speaking immigrants to acquire the lexicon-ic skill set required to succeed - it improves the efficiency of every segment of the economy and broader society - it narrows the venue for hatred to propagate - and it strengths America.¬† A single language limits the avenue to expediently and evilly classify people according to the ascribed trait of various races, instead of the desirable SHARED achieved state of the American RACE. You do not have to be Christian, white, Republican, or bigoted to see the great unifying value of the English language as our national language in America - all you have to be is a proud American and something other than an imbecile biased by indoctrination into the liberal RELIGIOUS FAITH of white and male SELF-HATRED and ENVY or elitist sanctioned racism and sexism against white men and Christians.

Did you notice that the combined % of the 4 groups add up to 100?¬† Why are Hispanics not included - are they not part of the population?¬† Do you believe that zero Hispanics get arrested = zero % of arrests?¬† You really need me to explain this?¬† Really you think I do not understand the statistics here - I took statistics and calculus and Physics - and biochemistry - and medial research classes - and graduated with a 4.0 gpa - and you think this is difficult for me - really????????? I would almost guarantee that bureaucratic census libs (maybe ACORN) intentionally combine Hispanics with non-Hispanic whites into a single demo.¬† This obscures both the Hispanic crime rate (which disappears) and the non Hispanic white crime rate (which increases by the addition of Hispanic crime) and also the black crime rate.¬† Because when blacks are compared against the combined white and Hispanic demo it doesn't seem as bad as when blacks are compared directly against the non Hispanic white crime rates.¬† Even the Hispanic crime rate is less than blacks so blacks would appear more prone to crime than the OTHER minority. I wrote that a black man is 9X as likely as a white man to add to the gun violence stats (which I committed to memory from a good source) that libs use to disarm the citizen - not coincidentally in complete violation of Madison's brilliant Bill of Rights and the 2nd Amendment.¬† If we use murder as a proxy for gun violence then - Blacks = 12% of the population = 50% of the murders.¬† A best estimate would be white non Hispanic = 67% of the population committing maybe 30% of the murders (leaving 18% for Hispanics = good guess). The simple math without getting back into the chart is blacks rate = 50 / .12 = 416.6 whites non Hispanic rate is 30 / .67 = 44.7 ratio 416.6 / 44.7 = 9.3 murders for every x number black American for one murder for per same number x of white Americans = exactly what I wrote in my earlier post. Hispanic + white 50 / .80 = 62.5 416.6 / 62.5 = 6.6 to 1 or just divide 80/12 = 6.6 to 1 = 6.6 murders for every x number blacks for every one murder for x number of whites including Hispanics. The total crime rate without doing the math on paper or calculator is about 3 to 1 or maybe 4 to 1 black to non Hispanic whites (depending on the Hispanic crime rate). I promise / pinky swear - These figures I have provided you with are correct or as close as I can get without more detailed data - which I am sure is fairly easy to obtain (and if not easy to obtain than evil forces are at work = libs pretend a problem doesn't exist is the same as it not existing = so just hide the data and the problem goes away).

But bear in mind what I said before about the strength of diversity. Here in the bay area, we've got a healthy mix of many world cultures and it's made us a liberal bastion, filled with productivity and promise. So much for "the decline of western civilization" I guess, huh? ¬† ¬†You're Rush Limbaughesque rant was so full of lies and exaggeration it hardly even seems worth refuting, especially the whole, "Liberals don't do science, WE DO!" thing. But one message is abundantly clear, you are terrified that WASPy Americans like yourself are endangered. The point about Asians naming their kids (or in many cases renaming themselves) with white sounding names is a fair one. But my experience is it has more to do with us dumb English speakers botching the pronunciation of their multi-tonal languages than your affirmative action b.s. ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†I dated a Chinese girl who changed her name to "Miranda" from "Mian", because if English speakers mispronounce her real name, it means "Noodle". It's really not as complicated as you make it out to be. And plenty of Asians hold onto their culture as well as their names. Many don't even like dating outside their race, which is essentially what ended my relationship with that chick...me not being Chinese. ¬† ¬† I get that you want to paint with Donald Trumps's broad brush and blame all our problems on immigrants and the rest of the world, what with it's pluralism and all, but my OP is sounding more and more spot on with every 150 line response you give me to it. You HATE that I pegged you for what you are, a racist nationalist. I only included christians in there because American christianity, our "national" religion, promotes this brand of xenophobia...thanks in part to the hard political work of Jerry Fallwell, a former segregationist. And the right-wing terrorists you all keep ignoring use religion to justify their fear and hatred as well. ¬† If you don't like what America is becoming, perhaps you should consider moving to one of those Scandinavian "monoliths" you say are immune to colonization by immigrates. However, you DO realize they are socialist countries, right? Higher education is paid by the state, equal opportunities abound. The rich actually pay their fair share of taxes (unlike here), and best of all....few are christian or believe in any god(s) at all. Sounds like a great place to live to me! ;)	UCMCcmE6HvlcellK13HQN_0A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMCcmE6HvlcellK13HQN_0A	1	UggkCQrlYCnEkHgCoAEC	Golgotha_Mythos69

A black American is 9X more likely than a white American to add to the gun murder statistics liberals use to justify disarming everyone but police.¬† Police have a higher murder conviction rate than the concealed carry permit holder - and we both know that cops can commit murder on video (Eric Gardner) and still not get convicted or even indicted.¬† Hispanic gun murder rates are 1/2 in between.¬† Black and Hispanic crime of all variety - out of wedlock child birth - absent fathers - drug abuse - dropout rate - and on and on are all abysmal and getting worse.¬† The drastic divide between black and white culture as measured by such stats got exponentially worse as the welfare state got bigger.¬† If you tax anything you get less of it - if you subsidize anything you get more of it.¬† Liberals have been taxing success and hard work and subsidizing black and Hispanic (and some other minorities) failure for 50 or so years in America now - and they have purchased a lot of failure for those votes.¬† America and western liberalism has created the first circumstance in world history where the successful copy or mimic the failure - because success to a liberal is not earned anymore than failure - its all beyond individual control - except for possibly the evil rich having cheated their way to success.¬† Asian Americans (which liberals find it OK to discriminate against) suffer no such cultural illness - we have never paid and encouraged them to fail and blame everyone else for it.¬† Asian children of immigrants often have names like John or Heather while blacks are naming their kid Malik or Hannef or Latefa.¬† As a parent if you know that John succeeds at a rate 3X that of Jammale - then name your kid John (this is so fucking stupid).¬† I had a fight with my wife about our daughters name = Christine = good idea = American not Christina = bad idea = Italian not American. In areas of the country where citizens speak English to each other the culture as measured by the above variables is not nearly as dire as in areas where English is not spoken.¬† If you turn on the idiot box you may find a show like Duck Dynasty but you can easily see the culture has TURNED very sharply DOWN and left not UP or right. Many of the problems in addition to and beyond the cultural CRASH described above (and not incidentally away from religion and Christianity - and also toward Islam) particularly with respect to debt - slowed growth - a weak economy - high unemployment - and devaluation of the currency that is occurring in America in direct concert with our steady PROGRESSIVE increasing shift to the left and away from TRADITIONAL AMERICA toward a fundamental transformation from our exceptional past into some facsimile of the FUCKED up entire rest of the GLOBAL VILLAGE¬† is also well underway in Europe. At one time the left thought that if only the principles from Marx and socialism could be applied within a democracy then they would not crash and burn like they have everywhere they have been attempted = Cuba - N Korea - Vietnam - USSR - China.¬† However democracy doesn't save Marxism or liberal policy.¬† As it turns out Marx and democracy mix like liberals and science = not at all.¬† Since Europe (and America) has gone more to the left and more socialist it is sinking faster than the HMS Titanic. Without Thatcher and now Cameron the UK would all ready be a third world country.¬† What parts of socialist Europe have resisted total collapse = the Nordic countries where they are a cultural and ethnic monolith = devoid of any diversity and without minorities (or Muslims). As more women have entered the workforce America has declined not improved.¬† Maybe the very very very very very important role of mom should be respected.¬† It is near impossible to find any work ethic in modern America.¬† In any dealings now its not a matter of what if something goes astray its just when and how bad.¬† I just retired because of the ACA which has made an already corrupted¬† environment far worse.¬† The two biggest problems in healthcare was the INS company (which is a total breakdown in CAPITALIST - free market forces = compulsory type two, type three, non direct spending) and the FDA.¬† The FDA is a direct socialist/government intrusion into the market = increasing the cost of new drugs by a factor of 50X - yes that is correct drug costs have increased after factoring for inflation 50X as a DIRECT result of FDA regs (there is so much more to this horrific story).¬† The ins company was an example of the very very very very very rare free market failure.¬† It failed precisely because free choice somehow got in the way of free choice and thus removed the consumer and provider away from normal market forces.¬† What does a lib do in such a circumstance = FORCE the very product (health ins - which should never be referred to or confused with healthcare) that was killing the much more important healthcare product. There has never been a woman grand national chess champion - never been a woman winner at the world series of poker.¬† Face book - the I phone and I pad - Napster - the Tesla - wiki leaks are all contribution by men not women.¬† Even Snowden is a man.¬† When you call for tech support with a computer problem a man talks you through the problem.¬† The next 50 big things that move the planet - good or bad will be the result of men not women.¬† The war of the sexes is over - I will not make the claim that men won because in such a sick and twisted war there are no winners - however I will state unequivocally that our daughters lost.¬† The fact that you do not know the factual difference between the genders is a perfect example of liberal science.¬† To a liberal science is a process of 1) making observations (women are not achieving on par with men) 2) isolating where the observed state differs with what they wish to be true (they should be doing as well) 3) then ordaining the certain truth as opposite of real world observation (women are as able as men for sure) 4) then denying any facts that run counter (its just a matter of bias = women are held back - if more women got the opportunity than they would contribute on par.) Since women have gotten more exposure to science - college - the workforce (all bad things) - their contribution to matters involving measurable intellect has remained essentially the same = zero.¬† They did not contribute before - during or now in the post feminist era.

So I'm Hispanic, does that mean I'm supposed to automatically support Ted Cruz? Uh....no. How on earth did you take what I said about American diversity and multiculturalism and twist it into, "even our unifying language is evil and should be replaced with divisive and inefficient pluralistic multi-lingualism"? Not even close. I AGREED with your about Latinos who don't bother to learn English, ffs. You just turned on the liberal hating filter.¬† Please provide proof for "the poverty perpetuating practice of multilingualism". I hear this nonsense from the far-right fairly often, but no one seems to be able to explain it. Same with the "buying votes" bullshit. Did it ever occur to you that people who vote democrat might just know something you don't, or perhaps, REFUSE to learn?? ¬†I like how you frame libertarians in the best possible light, and liberals in the worst, using science as a latch-key to validate these opinions. The reality of course, is exactly the opposite and is easily proven: ¬† ¬†The more adverse to facts one is politically, the more conservative they are by definition. That's because conservatives are hindered by facts, not helped. Take your anti-feminism claim (an odd inclusion in a thread ostensibly about racism/nationalism and American exceptionalism), that women will never be as smart of capable as men. Facts prove you wrong, but conservatives are CALLED conservative because they desire to CONSERVE tradition...in this case, the old fashioned idea that "a woman's place is in the home, with the children."¬† ¬† Yet thanks to republican and yes, even libertarian socioeconomic polices, the middle class is disappearing and couples NEED to both work just to stay afloat. So how do these conflicting ideas jive?¬† They don't. That's facts clashing with political ideology.¬† The same is true with the subject of this thread, multiculturalism and the white, conservative christian right's staunch resistance to it. Your rant just DRIPS with this animosity, btw....especially when you compare Michael Moore with the Black Panthers.¬† ¬† If you take an industry like computers, you see a wide array of different cultures (and genders, of course) represented there. I'm from the SF bay area, so this is close to home for me. There are smart folks from all over the world that converge and collaborate to make this thing called the information age chug along, with or without the WASPy traditionalists who hate all the facts and education it systematically disseminates.¬† ¬† That would seem to bear a striking contrast to the bleak picture you paint here of diversity. The more diverse a group of professionals are, the wider their influences. That makes for a far more creative and INNOVATIVE product, doesn't it? What you are selling is right-wing fear of the unknown. This defensive nationalism that paints the left as some 1950s era commie threat, conflating democratic socialism and pluralism with "loosing America". Again, sorry to burst your bubble, but that's just not what 's going on here. ¬† ¬†If the right represents brittle, rigid, immutable tradition and sanctity for a post-war American exceptionalism, the left represents the 21st century. Every fruit America bears comes from our diverse and robust gene pool, inseminating our culture with progressive ideas that move us forward....not backwards. "A typical liberal" doesn't care what "a typical libertarian" or his ugly, more religious cousin, "a typical conservative" thinks he TRULY is or stands for. We just push on, with or without you, and embrace the global village that is planet earth.

All religious doctrine pertaining to science is equally false = completely false.¬† However, this doesn't equate to equally good or evil practice in the real world.¬† Christians control the majority of the world's wealth and military might.¬† If Islam were in possession of even a fraction of this power the world would fall into instant nuclear holocaust.¬† The Muslim man hides behind Muslim women and children while intentionally targeting Jewish woman and children.¬† He depends on the moral standards of the Israel soldier, that is deemed the offspring of monkeys and pigs, to be restrained and hindered on a battlefield with Muslim women and children present.¬† Now imagine an Israeli soldier hiding behind a Jewish child to prevent incoming fire from the Muslim = this is beyond laughable - in fact the Muslim may die laughing. I just realized you are a chick or maybe gay = why so resentful toward Christian bigotry.¬† Also why not so tow the line leftest with respect to Muslim apologetics = in your heart you know that Islam is far more racist, misogynistic and homophobic than Christians. ¬† There is clearly still some lingering Christian bigotry toward gays because the text (of all 3 non pagan faiths) is prejudiced - no doubt.¬† However, Christians tend to be far less bigoted and far more tolerant than many others = just look and compare against your own religious bigotry. A Typical liberal thinks all form of cultural expression is just so wonderful - except any expression of the scarcity of American culture (even our unifying language is evil and should be replaced with divisive and inefficient pluralistic multi-lingualism).¬† America is evil¬† despite the INCONTROVERTIBLE FACT that evil America has attracted the most immigrants, lifted the most SOULS out of poverty, made the most native and immigrant millionaires, has in the past (not under our present liberal socialist system) provided the best and really only fluid movement between income strata, contributed the most scientific achievements (a group of INTERNATIONAL scientists rated America and AMERICANS as having contributed 36 of the 50 greatest scientific achievements of the 20th century - leaving 14 for the remainder of the world), has put more of its sons in harms way and ultimately sacrificed more of its sons in the fight against despotism and to promote liberty and security and peace, and provided the blueprint for democracy for the world to emulate.¬† This is the culture and its unprecedented achievements that you seek to destroy (fundamentally transform) from pillar to post not just improve via the reduction of racism and homophobic sentiment which has and is still subsiding.¬† Your racist aversion to whites, to Christians, and toward the English language is proof that you are inculcated in the evil liberal dogma - founded by Alinsky as his admittedly contrived propaganda as the means to procure his communist end. Pluralism is better exemplified as a show of¬† tolerance toward other perspectives about political commercials (coke) not as tolerant for the poverty perpetuating practice of multilingualism - thus insuring the perpetuation of a permanent underclass - that always conveniently votes liberal Democrat. Men out perform women in every measure of scientific ability and scientific societal contribution = the fact. A libertarian =¬† A scientist views this fact and wonders is the cause genetic, environmental, or both (knowing it s almost always both) and then forms a hypothesis and a means to test it but leaves it to the unfettered free choices of individuals in society to work it out without force or threat of violence. A conservative = non-scientist views this fact and thinks (knows) its probably both but almost certainly there is a FUCKING VERY STRONG genetic cause and goes about his business (thinking maybe the Bible has something to do with it). A liberal = anti-scientist may or may not even acknowledge the facts.¬† If he is forced to see them - he thinks that it is certainly a true fact that women are equally as smart as men (which is beyond stupid and almost as laughable as Israeli soldiers hiding behind Jewish little girls) and therefore any disparity is SURELY¬† a matter of discrimination and the evil oppressive capitalist environment.¬† Therefore he determines to make a law threatening more and more people with state violence until we force the equality of out come - which conveniently never comes.

Religion, like politics, is an IDEA, not an identity. So that means, those who are offended are actually expressing RACISM. I am not sure of your point here - I think you are drawing a distinction between an ascribed status as compared with an achieved status.¬† If this is the case¬† I accept - in fact I advance the notion - that human classification according to¬† ascribed status is generally improper and often evil (classification by age and gender is appropriate) and classification by achieved status is proper such as religion or political ideology.¬† People on both sides of the political divide seem to not understand this proper distinction.¬† However, predictably it is left that gets things more discombobulated and in a deleterious way. So that means, those who are offended are actually expressing RACISM. Get it? Not very 'christian-like' now, is it?Ôªø I am not sure what point you are making with this statement.¬† If need be you can clarify. Some on the left might, Ben Affleck famously did on "Real Time w/Bill Maher", when faced with Sam Harris who refers to islam as "the mother lode of bad ideas". Unfortunately, with muslims it's often more than just a "best guest". It was not just idiot Ben that took offense.¬† Sam Harris the objective scientist¬† (amazing that you bring him up because he singularly PROVES the point I am making to 100% certainty) was the darling of left when He was perceived as a man attacking organized religion particularly Christianity = attacking Western and American CONSERVED culture.¬† However, when this OBJECTIVE scientist moved to more specific critique and pointed out the GLARING differences and EVIL consequences between Islam (factually the mother load of bad ideas) and pretty much all other religion - the same people that viewed him as the SECOND coming turned on him in a vicious and personal attack.¬† I could have told Sam (who was shocked and wounded) that this would happen = when you lay down with shit heads you get crapped up.¬† Harris quite frankly STUPIDLY BELIEVED that leftist were anti-religion because they were pro science.¬† This is ABSURD because nothing is more anti-science then a liberal.¬† There hatred of CHRISTIANITY has nothing to do with the relative merit or clear lack of merit in the canon. Liberals hate Christianity exclusively above all other religion not because it is worse than other religion (its not worse it FAR better as even Harris knows and points out) it is particularly because Christianity is West and is American and the LIBERAL RELIGION is only a twisted religion founded by Alinsky as a counter to America the West and capitalism.¬† Alinsky himself wrote that the biggest enemy to communism in America in particular is not capitalism its Christianity.¬† This is so profound and so explains - even if you do not know it - why you have animus particularly for Christianity.¬† You resent Christians because you were taught to by your left wing predecessors that were taught Alinsky propaganda to tear down Christianity to make room for socialism. OK so you seem to point out that you are not the cookie cutter leftest (Whoopie and Joy) = Islamic apologist because the enemy of my enemy (my enemy is my own CONSERVED culture) is my friend and do not attack my terrorist apologist friend.¬† OK so you want to proclaim you are not the cookie cutter leftist that is so hypersensitive to political correctness = good for you.¬† However, you are left enough to see bigotry where there is only American pride and a desire to save America which is OUR = people of all ethnic background and skin color country that needs propping up because she is falling down under the weight of division-ism.

They're both idiot demographics -¬† American whites are mostly muslims, so it's kind of moot.- Presumably you meant Christian but either way your post is religious bigotry and is a perfect example of the left-wing CREATION = hate speech.¬† Such speech has been clearly identified by the left as hateful religious prejudice in all cases within America unless the victim is Christian.¬† It is just a matter of absolute¬† FACT that for the vast majority of the vocal and active left = it is perfectly OK to attack Christians with otherwise censored hate speech.¬† This is an amazing liberal phenomenon = how Americans and even Europeans prefer to attack the religion and all aspects of their own cultural heritage and is a form of self hatred and national suicide. ¬†Did you watch the video? Are YOU offended? Why or why not? I watched the video and yes I found it offensive but that is not the crux.¬† It is more harmful divisive and dangerous than offensive.¬† It was a political add - make no mistake about this - and those that produced it know this and intended to make a political point. First America is a relatively young country - it was founded by immigrants in search of an escape from oppression - and this immigrant phenomenon continued in even greater force after our founding - which started in 1776 and finalized in 1787 - until a refounding in the early 1860s America has no real ethnicity - which in the past was a source of strength.¬† Americans have no real skin tone but tended to be more white than anything else = also a good thing. Not having a long shared history and being a MELTING pot of many ethnic backgrounds and skin shades = America is weakly positioned to enjoy the GREAT benefits of cultural unity.¬† Therefore it is important to nurture whatever unifying forces we have access to.¬† Nothing unites people more than a shared language - it is much more powerful than race or skin tone.¬† In any foreign situation people that speak the same language find each other and ubiquitously extend the benefit of any doubt.¬† People tend toward magnanimity with those they can easily communicate and tend to distrust those with whom they can't.¬† The strongest inherited culture in America by far is from the UK and our language has been from the start English. It is much better for America as a one nation competing in a harsh world of many nations for its people to enjoy the GREAT unifying and efficient benefits of one language.¬† For example I am a physician and cannot provide care nearly as well or as fast to any patient with a communication deficit.¬† I had to schedule extra time for exams of non English speaking patients and often had to use staff as an interpreter.¬† This not only negatively effects the care of those that cannot speak the language of their country but also the care of other patients that can.¬† It also negatively effects my ability to make a living while concomitantly keeping medical expenses down.¬† This inefficiency is not peculiar to medicine and spans the gambit of our markets and society. There are zero or almost zero non English speaking success stories from America.¬† English is the language of success in America.¬† One reason why Spanish speaking immigrants fare so poorly compared to Asians or really any immigrants from most other part of the non Spanish world is because of the Spanish language.¬† If a person speaks only Mandarin or Japanese or German = it is very difficult for them to get by in America = so they are essentially fortuitously compelled to learn English.¬† But with all the bilingual Spanish crap in America a person can get by here speaking only Spanish = they can survive often with gov assistance but not succeed.¬† Placating this form of low standards is very harmful and promulgated by liberal Despots just to purchase votes.¬† This form of separatism cause a permanent underclass that never achieves self-reliance and represents a huge voting block even if not legal citizens.¬† For example it unifies the vote of supportive relatives and friends, it represents a future voter in the form of amnesty or other paths including child birth from a non citizen - and yes illegals vote in needed districts where they are bused to and not required to show ID and then compensated.¬† This is the prime mover behind the fight against voter ID.¬† Another equally important factor is the evil (inherent in almost all aspects of liberalism) to cause or drive up animosity between races (or between any demographics).¬† ¬† Illegal Immigration - a national language - stress on the welfare state are all hot political topics.¬† A commercial that was INTENTIONALLY designed to prop up the very very wrong and so devastatingly harmful side of contentious political issues should be received with righteous outrage.¬† If the song was we are the world = well coke can and should sell to a world market.¬† They can do this without further advancing the notion of the non integrating immigrant that BELONGS in the country that speaks the language they prefer. The non integrating immigrant should be properly ostracized by the society where they come to and then act to transform into the society they fled from. ¬†	UCIdOk2-jZ23HJDdE3bTDX7Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIdOk2-jZ23HJDdE3bTDX7Q	1	UggkCQrlYCnEkHgCoAEC	Golgotha_Mythos69

Unfortunately, with muslims it's often more than just a "best guest". I took an educated guess. The fact that it pisses people off, even while they are PROVING MY POINT, more than counters your "argument" here. 2) Yup, some would. But most would agree with me based on the MO expressed here. It's white,conservative christians in America who are most often anti-immigration and insanely xenophobic, not other groups. Not catholic Latinos. Not Black protestants. Not even muslims. W.A.S.P.s, that's who. Facts are facts, much as they grate on your self-image. Want proof? How fast did Donald Trump shoot up in the polls after his hideously insensitive, racist comments? It seems there's a WHOLE LOT of republicans who fit the bill here, doesn't it? 3) Both are equally racist AND homophobic. The bible is actually more violent than the qu'ran...ask me to prove it. I would LOVE that! ¬†¬† The difference here in America is that people don't put up with that so much. It's not PC.. Secular progress has softened the christain bigotry in our society at large, but you don't have to look far to see its ugliest faces revealed. The islamic world is still in their dark ages in many ways, and few criticize their religion. That doesn't mean it's worse, it just means christians have to contend with more logic & reason countering their bible-based assertions. We've had a rights revolution here (women, blacks, gays, etc), the islamic world, not so much... 4) MANY, but the thing is, they tend not to talk about it in mixed company because they know how socially unacceptable it is. How many christians do YOU know who are mortified that gay marriage is legal nationwide now? Would you call them "homophobic" or just, "good, solid, moral christians"? Sorry to burst your bubble, but it's the former, not the latter. How many do you know who mistrust immigrants, be they legal or illegal? How many think every muslim is a potential terrorist?? ¬†¬† Based on your constant comparisons here, sounds like that includes YOU.

They're both idiot demographics in THIS context.Of course, American whites aren't mostly muslims, so it's kind of moot. Did you watch the video? Are YOU offended? Why or why not? How would you explain the people who were? I'll ask you what I asked the other guy, What's wrong with pluralism? What's wrong with multi-culturalism? ¬†¬†¬† What is it about "American the beautiful" being sung in multiple languages that ANYONE could possibly find offensive? I'm referring to the extreme right-wing here, not ALL christians. You fall into the same trap that so many do, calling what I'm saying or what other liberals say "hate speech" because we've got you cornered and won't put up with this shit anymore.Who is the one really hating here, those of us who call a spade a spade, or the people who hate on immigrants because, "They'z just different, and they'z takin' over our country!"?? ¬†One more factor you're overlooking. Religion, like politics, is an IDEA, not an identity. So that means, those who are offended are actually expressing RACISM. Get it? Not very 'christian-like' now, is it?

This comment is not bigoted at all - right? It is just amazing how stupid liberals are. Only a liberal would use their own bigoted hate speech to denounce bigotry (imaginary bigotry). A liberal uses their own hate speech to attack large groups of people by force fitting all members of a group into their false and prejudiced perceptions. I would almost guarantee that I could get a diametrically opposing response from you by tweaking just a one word from your own hate speech. My best guess is that they are simply racist, homophobic right-wing (not Christians but) Muslims. Now you can recognize your own hate speech as hate speech - right? Even though I would be scientifically accurate to point out that Christians are far more tolerant as a group about matters of race, and sexual orientation. Modern day Christians are the most charitable large group on the planet. Modern Christians are amongst the most compassionate people. And with respect to the vast power Christians wield, they show remarkable restraint and tolerance for other religions and counter positions. For example, NO (or far less than one percent) Christians want to stone gays to death - but the vast majority of Islam thinks homosexuality is a crime that should be punished by the state and codified law including many that believe gays should be murdered as such. I really have a difficult time understanding how your form of STUPIDITY is contagious - why can't all see right through this nonsense?????

You must have something stupid in your mouth, because it's hard to understand you. Republicans lost that debate because segregation is no more. The social engineering that drives this perceived "segregation" is the cause of intolerance - every ghetto on the planet since the days of Acre's prime are the cause of the rich, pious and cold-hearted self-serving bigots' entire agenda being played through to it's conclusion.

My folks have friends and even some relatives who've been here for decades who still don't. Some of them have a good excuse, they're old and live in a cultural bubble. Others don't have a good excuse at all. But I was under the impression America welcomed people of other cultures. Earlier, I shared how my parents didn't teach us Spanish, or pass on very many Hispanic traditions. We are a very white-bread family compared to other Hispanics I know. Do you think (or rather, do you suppose those who were offended think) everyone who becomes an American should ALSO forget their ¬†respective cultures and/or customs? ¬† ¬†There's more to language than just communication. It symbolizes that foreign culture. Being bilingual is an asset today, not just for those who travel for business or pleasure, but for being a more well rounded and sociable adult. I could give a million reasons for it. I don't see this ad as a negative in any way because I've been around the Spanish language my whole life and wish I was bilingual, atleast then I would have retained something vital of my culure. But the point was to reach out and to unite. So it failed to do that. Why? Is it because folks were offended by the "butchering" of the song or because folks were offended by the idea of people coming here and not bothering to learn English? If it's the former, that seems silly, but since conservatives are into the whole "sanctity" thing, I get it. If it's the latter, that's just racist. Sorry. Who says they won't bother to learn English just because a few verses of this thing are in their language? Again, America is a melting pot and always has been. ¬† ¬† ¬† No one has to agree with me, all I did was call a spade a spade. It's racist to reject this message of unity. There's nothing wrong with America's multiculturalism. France, Japan, China, etc...none of these countries have a tradition of multiculturalism. None of them. So the comparison is unfair. What does the plaque on the statue of liberty read? "Learn English or get out!"?? Lol!

Don't go to France and expect to be accommodated. ¬†You'll probably not last too long there unless you speak French.

The song is divisive or the fact that in the ad they translated it into various languages is divisive? Who did it not unite? Do you think everyone who saw this commercial was equally offended? Let's take this back to the 70s again, since I'm no troll and like to stay on topic. ¬† That "hippie" ad about teaching the world to sing in harmony, that's not too far removed from MLK's message, is it? ¬†So if Coke, or liberals, or whoever is trying desperately to get the world to unite, and some people don't like that idea or resist it publicly, what exactly does that say about them? ¬† ¬†You claim the evidence shows this particular ad divided people. Who rejected its message? Was I WAY OFF in calling a spade a spade?

Are they merely offended by the translations? Why? You're not really making any sense here. I get the strong suspicion you're doing damage control as well Say for a second it WAS a different song, like the original 70s jingle about "buying the world a coke". Would that be offensive if it were in various languages? Why or why not? ¬† Is it merely the sanctity of the patriotic song that you are incensed about, or the symbolic message of unity and multiculturalism it implies for America? Why? So far you haven't done the best job in convincing me that I was that far off the mark. America was built by immigrants. If you, as a white person, are feeling like you'll soon be the minority here, just say so. It's ok. I already called that one. That's what's going to happen, whether you like it or not.

I don't care if you're a Pepsi guy, or if you think soda is best used to clean your toilet (it IS, supposedly), my OP was concerned with WHY there was such "outrage" of a message of unity, peace, and other "teary-eyed liberal" ideals.

"Measures of racial prejudice most commonly assessed modern and symbolically racist attitudes toward Blacks (McConahay et al., 1981) or preferred level of social distance from Blacks or other racial minorities (Altemeyer & Hunsberger, 1992).3" This quote cites this paper https://www.surrey.ac.uk/politics/research/researchareasofstaff/isppsummeracademy/instructors%20/Has%20racism%20declined%20in%20America.pdf The problem with this paper is that this was written at a time when the issue of racism was pushed most strongly on the American public, where not being for things like affirmative action was considered racist. ¬†Because of that, answering a questionnaire in a way of "Blacks have no reason to be angry," is seen as racist even though the person answering might have very different motivations other than racism for answering such a thing. Considering this citation essentially defines what racism is to the author, it's easy to understand how they would come to such a conclusion, but the definition that the author chooses for racism and the material they depend on is absolutely misleading. ¬† Someone can answer those questions in the "racist" way but not be actual racists, and that's where the article drops the ball. The original cites the oft-misconstrued religiosity index, where people commonly associate this with a scale of atheism to theism. ¬†Of course, the paper claims no such thing. ¬†The religiosity scale is based on how often people do religious activities, not how religious they are. ¬†You can score a 0 on the religiosity index and love God very much. *America belongs to all of us?* Sure, but speak fucking English. ¬†People don't go down to Mexico without knowing some Spanish, and the Mexicans aren't going to accommodate. ¬†England has an official language. ¬†France has an official language. ¬†We need one as well. ¬†Again, it's pointless for money to be spent to accommodate multiple languages. English please. ¬†Nothing against you coming here, but show some respect toward our country and learn our language. *Illegals don't vote?* What? ¬†You think that a checkbox and a utility bill are insurmountable obstacles to illegals voting in non-ID states? ¬† Of course not. ¬†They do vote.

These are your words. ¬†Yes, you did call people who disagree with you racist. ¬† When propaganda speaks for you, you're doing the opposite of "progressing" on anything. Nobody said that this defiles the sanctity of our national anthem because America The Beautiful is not our national anthem. ¬†Calling people idiots while not knowing what our national anthem is is not smart. *Unity?* This song did not unify anyone, it divided them. ¬†I'm not interested in your teary-eyed Liberal emotard response. ¬†What I'm interested in are results. Did the ad divide or did it unite? It damn sure didn't unite, as we all saw after it happened. ¬†It sparked bitter political controversy. ¬† Fact is that, if this was a message of unity from Coke, it failed badly. ¬† *Blaming immigration?* People don't blame immigration for our problems. They blame illegal immigration for our problems. There's nothing wrong with legal immigrants. Of course, we all know that your mission is for these illegals to cross over the border and vote for Democrats who are soft as a cookie on the laws of the land. ¬† *White privileged?* Hispanics are only non-white when it's convenient for you, lol. ¬†Again, this has nothing to do with caring about hispanics as it does you wanting illegals to vote for Democrats. *Coke is wrong for 40 years?* We're talking about a very specific ad. ¬†Don't throw red herrings because I'm not going to chase them.

I said people who think these coke ads are "sacrilege" or "defile the sanctity of our national anthem" are idiots. My best guess is that they are simply racist, homophobic right-wing christians. I'm sure many aren't, but that's how the political landscape looks these days. It's ironic that anyone who eludes to UNITY or pluralism is somehow labeled unAmerican. How else would you explain that other than racism? ¬†What the hell is wrong with world unity and pluralism anyway? I don't know about you, but from where I'm standing, it appears the extreme right-wing, white privileged in America are the only ones complaining like this, blaming immigration for our problems or whatever. The rest of us embrace all cultures and nations. Isn't that what America is supposed to stand for, multiculturalism? Is Coke WRONG to have suggested this for 40+ years now? Why? Can you refute that without invoking white privilege? I'd like to hear it...	UCMCcmE6HvlcellK13HQN_0A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMCcmE6HvlcellK13HQN_0A	1	UggkCQrlYCnEkHgCoAEC	Golgotha_Mythos69

Coke has always appealed to an international demographic, for better or worse. They sell it everywhere in the world. My point is, these racist nationalists who were offended by the new ad are clueless. Since when is world unity a bad idea?

They both want to protect and accomplish the same things politically; not necessarily the exact same things - but, nonetheless, the same things overall in terms of childish apathy and xenophobic noninterventionism, on a Federal and international level. Yea, not all libertarians are white supremacists, granted; some libertarians are vehemently against bigotry, support gay marriage, etc., which is funny, in a way; they support white supremacy, at least politically, and personally are opposed to it...

I'm still wise enough to not take it all at face value, and learn more for myself though. I feel people come to this because it is opinionated, not because it isn't.¬† As for Fox, I've heard that it does tend to twist or lie about it's facts, and have been caught doing so, but I wouldn't know - and has something I've never cared to look into since I don't watch Fox. I think paying for TV is a waste when all the information you could ever need is on the internet, through various news channels and other resources.¬†	UCxLlyF2K_yTm4PZtOFHQVew	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxLlyF2K_yTm4PZtOFHQVew	1	UghCgnBVRyMZMHgCoAEC	rizzzla

I'll never forget the first time I personally saw Dan Rather lie deliberately. He said, "At Bob Dole's poltical rally, when asked what his thoughts were on abortion, his handlers quickly had him whisked out of the room." About a week later while watching C-SPAN's coverage of a Bob Dole event, which I like to watch unfiltered news so I can form my own opinion, after the speech Bob Dole answered questions. After answering quite a few he asked if there were anymore questions. After waiting a few seconds no one raised their hands so BD thanked them for coming out and informed them where he would be headed next. He then proceeded to shake hands and make small talk for about 10 minutes before he slowly exited the stage. Just before disappearing behind the curtain a woman's voice yelled, Bob what's your take on abortion? Obviously, those were probably not her exact words, but it was about abortion and the deliberate lying of CBS and Dan Rather. Dan Rather is a partison person in the first degree as are all "newsman" in the mainstream press.

Fox denies their bias and says they are fair and balanced while ¬†TYT have clearly said that they are a progressive news channel. Also, TYT, while having a big bias they actually do attack both sides, the right more but there's reasons for that. And Fox only attacks the left and makes shit up on a daily basis(Yes TYT is wrong as well, propobly a lot, but they arent actively making shit up.

It seemed to me that you had some very valid points pertaining to extremely controversial subjects. However, as I continued to watch the material that your organization pumps out regularly, it came to my attention (quite rapidly mind you) that your anchors are some of the most biased ignoramuses I have ever had the misfortune to encounter. Though I acknowledge that this is the material that you tell them they are allowed to report on, this fact alone does not excuse them from the blatant pollution of academia. Pushing countless hours of liberal propaganda trash to the masses.	UC7UJ9S2fb4-yw96mDboAWlQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7UJ9S2fb4-yw96mDboAWlQ	0

I also generally approve of your take on the news, with the major exception of your astounding cluelessness about the threat that islam poses to the entire world. Look what&#39;s happening in Europe and the results of governments caving in to muslim demands at every turn.<br />Now look at our own country and the recent muslim protest against easter egg hunts - <b>easter egg hunts</b> - because they are &quot;un-islamic&quot; and violate the well-known muslim stance in favor of the separation of state and superstition, unless it&#39;s their superstition of course. This is what they do: start small with things like this, and if they get their way make bigger and bigger demands backed by the threat of violence when they become numerous enough to make that threat credible.<br />You also seem to be quite careless in calling any opposition to muslims a form of racism, which is plain <b>idiotic</b> since islam is not a race and muslims come from all ethnic backgrounds! This disingenuous accusation is a major tool muslims use to silence the more politically-correct among us, whose greatest fear bar none is to ever be called racist for any reason whether it&#39;s legitimate or not - and tragically this is effective on far too many well-meaning but logic-challenged people.<br />The other tool is to label anyone who criticzes anything they do, even if it&#39;s running a red light - as an &quot;islamophobe&quot; who must not be listened to. A phobia is an <b>irrational</b> fear, and there is nothing irrational about fearing a muslim takeover: they are few here now, but they have as many children as they can and all you have to do is the math to realize the worst could happen in a matter of a very few decades.<br />Islam is an evil, violent cult that&#39;s in its inquisitorial phase as vicious if not more so as the christian variety of a few hundred years ago. To ignore this characteristic in the name of &quot;tolerance&quot; is the worst mistake anyone who values humanitarian ideals can make. Just think of what your sexually-mutilated daughters and persecuted homosexual children will think of you in a couple more generations if you let this happen.

Almost every European country has it, and none of them seem to mind much.<br /><br />I mean, in Germany you find whole towns who have signs in German and Sorbian or Frisian, in GB you find Welsh, Scottish and Irish, in Spain they speak Catalan and Basque as well as Galician, in Italy it is German and Ladin as well as Friuli, and so on..... :-)¬†	UCItvw9U41xNiX9TUJpKDLpg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCItvw9U41xNiX9TUJpKDLpg	0

After all, part of immigration is assimilation. When you move to a new culture and a new country you don&#39;t keep ALL your old customs, this includes language. The majority of the population speaks English. Speak English, don&#39;t fuck it up because you think you should keep and use your old language exclusively.¬†	UCPndsQeFInqPWkoNBVfrZqA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPndsQeFInqPWkoNBVfrZqA	0

And its not accents we're talking about, nobody cares about accents, what I don't get is how someone can move to a country and expect to live and work there without learning the language spoken by the vast majority of people there? Your case also isn't a good example because being stationed in a country because of your work in the army does not count as voluntarily moving to a country.

"I think many of them fear losing their culture by permitting others' to be presented. I myself like the English language, and it is my profession, in fact. But people who are xenophobic like this should work harder to spend their taxes on education to reach immigrants and their ability to speak English, not necessarily for cultural preservation, but mainly to boost inter-community communication and bonds with different groups or ahem types of people. This invested effort by Americans would potentially be influencing what immigrants view as their language or their culture, while learning things about other cultures, and they'd have greater interests in "integrating", and I mean truly integrating, by bonding with English-speaking Americans, all the while introducing new aspects from their native culture. Anthropologically, this is a sound possibility, so long as people can become invested, literally, in the endeavor.. If they care, they should think of a proper, mutually beneficial and loving solution. Bitching on Twitter won't cut it. It's not about assimilation; it's about creating community: COMMon, COMMunicative UNITY, or even "a noun of quality ... meaning 'fellowship, community of relations or feelings", from the Latin communitatem."

I will add my 2-cents. I have traveled the world for work not pleasure. I have seen first hand many different cultures from the rock bottom poorest laborer to the top of their respective business leaders. One thing that becomes a common thread is the leaders all speak English or pay interpreters to speak it for them (which costs $$$). How does that apply here in the USA. If a immigrant from any nation comes here and does not learn English their economic potential is stiffled. The jobs they can get, even if well educated, are minimized. Some, can and do start their own businesses but even those are often only within areas that only speak that language.<br />One current area that can be easily compared is Quebec Canada. Some there speak English but refuse to, others cannot speak it at all. There seems to be a feud between the English speaking Canadians and French speaking Canadians. How this affects their work, thus income generating potential, is that those who only speak French are limited in their job growth. They can work in Quebec but have trouble finding work in Toronto.<br />Its not a culture issue, its a communication issue. If I am working on a job and can only speak one language and it is not the most common language of that country then I need an interpreter. In other countries this is expected, in the USA it is a bad idea. If a person comes here from a different country it is IN THIER BEST INTEREST to learn or at least teach their children to speak English. Not for any other reason than to allow for the maximum economic potential of that person. However, multi-lingual people have very high job potential. (In Canada and other countries as well.)<br />The worst country I ever visited had 40 distinct languages and over 400 dialects that included English, French, and German. One persons sentence could include multiple words from many of each. They could not communicate amongst themselves much less with me.

You know those Muslim's over in the middle east blowing themselves up? They are conservatives. You know those people who killed those doctors and set off those bombs? Conservatives. You heard of the KKK? You guessed it, Conservatives. Of course most Conservatives are racist. They are the ones who are against any non-white who try to become citizens. They are the ones that want to build a wall between us and Mexico but aren't interested in Canadian walls. They are the ones that get pissed when someone else doesn't speak English fluently. So they aren't claiming republicans or libertarians or moderates are racist. We think conservatives are very likely to be racist and/or terrorists though. They are the ones who hate the black president and wont shut up about taking over the country with their militia groups right?¬† Don't like it?

I myself like the English language, and it is my profession, in fact. But people who are xenophobic like this should work harder to spend their taxes on education to reach immigrants and their ability to speak English, not necessarily for cultural preservation, but mainly to boost inter-community communication and bonds with different groups or *ahem* types of people. This invested effort by Americans would potentially be influencing what immigrants view as their language or their culture, while learning things about other cultures, and they'd have greater interests in "integrating", and I mean truly integrating, by bonding with English-speaking Americans, all the while introducing new aspects from their native culture. Anthropologically, this is a sound possibility, so long as people can become invested, literally, in the endeavor.. If they care, they should think of a proper, mutually beneficial and loving solution. Bitching on Twitter won't cut it. It's not about assimilation; it's about creating community: COMMon, COMMunicative UNITY, or even "a noun of quality ... meaning 'fellowship, community of relations or feelings", from the Latin communitatem.

So what. Even a brain dead talentless cunt nerd/dork internet news anchor who should be hosting a video game talk show for teenage boys to jerk off to drinks coke. So what.

Big deal. I don&#39;t judge anyone, I drink coke also. Even If a dirty sexual repressed Muslim woman hating child rapist drank a coke, it wouldn&#39;t change my like or dislike for coke. Unless they can conclusively show that coke itself is causing all this fucked up shit in society I&#39;m going to continue drinking it.

And if you don&#39;t like there way your racist or sexist. And the fucking minorities are mostly democrat because the democrats aim for the lower denominator, and that just happens to be minorities most of the time. Thats not racist just think about it, minorities have been repressed for a long time. And the repressed would happen to be a good handful of minorities. And the dumb ass&#39;s think the Republicans are racist? Just cause they don&#39;t bring up the subject 500 times a day to show people there not racist doesn&#39;t mean they are racist. The Democrats are the true racists. They where closely related to the confederates! You know why the democrats supported the confederate movement? cause the poor white farmers didn&#39;t want to have to pay the expensive tariffs or loose there slaves. And those poor farmers were the repressed! And no you dumb fucking Young Turks its not racist to not want the song to be sung in other languages! Language does not equal race and if you think it does your racist. The song is an AMERICAN song and the ones who fought for our independence mostly spoke ENGLISH. Theirs a reason the constitution is written in ENGLISH. And no honesty it really doesn&#39;t bother me that they sung it in other languages. And bottom line, any one who connects to a party even when that party is retarded (And both parties have proven to be retarded) are themselves retarded, and are also mindless slaves.

O beautiful for spacious skies, For amber waves of grain, For purple mountain majesties Above the enameled plain! America! America! God shed His grace on thee, Till souls wax fair as earth and air And music-hearted sea! O beautiful for pilgrim feet Whose stern, impassioned stress A thoroughfare for freedom beat Across the wilderness! America! America! God shed His grace on thee Till paths be wrought through wilds of thought By pilgrim foot and knee! O beautiful for glory-tale Of liberating strife, When once or twice, for man's avail, Men lavished precious life! America! America! God shed His grace on thee Till selfish gain no longer stain, The banner of the free! O beautiful for patriot dream That sees beyond the years Thine alabaster cities gleam Undimmed by human tears! America! America! God shed His grace on thee Till nobler men keep once again Thy whiter jubilee!

I bet they also want muslims who immigrate to stop practicing female genital mutilation, honor killings and sharia law! Damned racist idiots! Right Ana?<br /><br />** sarcasm off **<br />Ok, a lot of your right wingers actually are racists in ways that matter. And multiculturalism is all nice and fluffy in theory and having people with such different perspectives mixing together is a powerful thing. But in practice... ask the people from UK how they like having sharia courts in their country.<br /><br />A certain degree of assimilation should be mandatory for immigrants and some of their cultural baggage should be left at the border. And it is the right of the people into whose country you are immigrating to set the rules by which they will allow you into their home.

I understand the multicultural marketing, but for most Americans, because football is an American sport, maybe it should've showcased different cultures, but it could've been done in English. I guess it did get me to pay attention to see what the hell they were selling. The melting pot idea isn't what it used to be. I think 9-11 had quite a bit to do with that, which is probably a factor in the way people reacted. Which, judging by what these guys were saying, was mostly white, right wing Republicans. I hate to say it's typical, but I do it anyway. Because it is. Our days of having only white presidents is over. With the minorities (all races other than white) becoming the majority, Caucasian Americans are becoming the minority. With that being said, it will be very difficult for the Republicans to get a member of their party into the White House if they can't get a grip on their old school racist mentality. The good 'ol party is full of good 'ol boys, and none of them aren't white. (I know that sounded weird.) Anyway, that's my thoughts. Do with it what you will.

If a friend of yours has a tragedy and he and his family needed refuge and turn to you, do you welcome them in? If you say yes, how would you run things? Would you let them rearrange your furniture, take over your fridge, use you computer 24/7, hog your TV, your phone, sleep all over your house, dirty all your dishes, and run you life? Would you let them take down all you pictures and decorations and put up their idols and their pictures? How long would you last in your own home if you give up your privacy, your way of life, your traditions and habits, food etc? They count on your "pity".

So here&#39;s how these lefty-loonies &quot;create&quot; something where there is nothing: 1) Alan West is OBVIOUSLY not racist but simply feels that a deeply traditional American anthem should be sung in English (the &quot;American&quot; language). I disagree with him as I would like to see English and Spanish as our national languages, BUT that does not make him racist. 2) Glen Beck was BRILLIANT in making the observation that Coca-Cola KNEW that their ad would cause some &quot;division&quot; amongst Americans who think like Alan West (again, not necessarily racist). He was NOT making a personal judgment. And Coca-Cola is NOT ignorant. He was right about the left using the &quot;racist&quot; accusation. These loonies here TOTALLY proved his genius. 3) Coca-Cola, by definition, IS an &quot;American Company&quot; that serves the world, as do most major American companies. The current CEO was born in New York and is a dual Turkish-American citizen. 4) Todd Starnes is correct but not-necessarily racist nor implying that all non-whites are illegal. The loonies are putting words in his mouth, as they do with all whom they disagree. Most conservatives I know do not really like Todd anyway. 5) And who the h311 is BudLightBro and Davis Wilson? So they found a couple of nuts on Twitter? Who cares what they think? I&#39;ll bet they were both Obama supporters. 6) Finally, M. P. Leahy appears to me to be simply making observations about the commercial, not judgements. But ALL lefty-loonies can see in others is what is in fact in their own hearts: RACISM, HATE, PREJUDICE, and INTOLERANCE. I call it as I see it. I was once a Democrat but now Independent (I support whoever I think is best).	UCAz50beAlwG99oG5Lc9HUbA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAz50beAlwG99oG5Lc9HUbA	0

All people alive today have their mitochondrial DNA from one woman who lived 160,000 years ago, in Africa, and all men alive today have their Y chromosome from one man who lived between 140,000 and 500,000 years ago, also in Africa. There are also genetic groupings called haplogroups, which shows up in the mitochrondrial DNA. Different waves of humans left Africa at different times around 100,000 years ago, and because isolated groups intermarry and because benign mutations constantly arise, each group will eventually spread its particular genetic markers throughout its group and not outside of it (until relatively recently). That's it in a nutshell. For more information you might watch the show "National Geographic: The Human Family Tree" or any other documentary by Spencer Wells, or read his book The Journey of Man.

Those that are afraid of this have a valid point. The powers that be go into nations and destroy them. They take away indivuals way of life reducing their lifestyle and earning power. Then they are encouraged these peoples to flood into other counties which creates slave classes with Human trafficking for sex, child sex and slave workers. It brakes up their families and destroys lives. Wages falls for all, taxes rise and areas are distroyed because they can&#39;t be supported with falling revenues and increased populatios to support, not all pay taxes. Homes are lost.<br /><br /> the stock market crash theft caused mass foreclosures, now the banksters are just selling our lands to foreign counties like China.

I dont hate that they used races other than black or white. What I hate is that they use one of our national songs in an ad campaign to sell there poisonous product. It is a disgrace to the PEOPLE of America (and to other countries for that matter) to use our national song as their ad campaign when (like they said in the video) they are trying to sell their product to people all over the world.

There are immigrants who are truly proud Americans, but most I have seen are still patriotic to the country they came from. I think this song being sung by so many other nationalities, for which we don&#39;t know if they are truly patriotic to our country, is what rubbs them the wrong way.

Uggx_1330YGfIXgCoAEC	5	4	2014-02-07 08:32:57	Justice is CLEAR	Great job race baiting. <br />Sorry but calling out a group as racist because you focus on a minority of them to represent them as a whole is Stereotyping, bigoted and propaganda driven. You are as transparent and obvious as a used car salesman pulling out all the stops to sale a lemon to a lemming. Have integrity, push your agenda with facts and not emotional manipulation of the unsuspecting. Racism is wrong especially when it&#39;s used to foster an unfair stereo type upon a group instead of recognizing the individuals as the racist, not the group. Of course specific hate groups by design states the racist hate as a requirement for membership, ie KKK. Last I heard no party, Democrat nor Republican nor conservative or liberal requies racist hatred as a factor for membership. Both sides need to quit with the false narrative of racism and promoting it to further help divide our nation. <br />Divide and conquer or unite and overcome adversities!

It is a way to lump together and discredit a grou project because of a few. Unfortunately you take my comments to imply I'm Republican or racist myself which is a false assumption as well. In the very beginning she infers that msnbc was right about the group being racist. It's a insult to everyone who sent in pictures of their own bi-racial families to disprove that myth and furthers the attack again claiming these bigoted and racist individuals can speak for anyone other than their own ignorant selfs. Again its the divide and conquer technique. Both of them lumped an entire political group together and inferred to that the group as racist, just as you just did. "The right wing loves to be racist" is a broad stereotype that cannot apply to everyone and is unfair to apply it to anyone who haven't proven themselves to be racist. Racist is a word that should be given to the actions of a individual or the sanctioned actions a group. I knoa of no political party that sanctions racism. That doesn't mean there aren't racist from every political party and ethnic and racial background. I personally am very racist, I believe that the Human race is the greatest race of creatures on planet earth and any further sub-classification is just the same as separating green eyes from blue eyes. Race is an artificial grouping of humanity and hopefully one day we will stop this.

I dont hate this commercial, I think it shows the diversity of this nation which is wonderful. I do not understand why that they all couldnt have sang it in english. Since english is the language spoken in America. Everyone knows that we have people from everywhere living here and that is what made this country special. I think everyone living in America should speak english. It is rude when you are out with people and they switch to another language, because they do not want you to understand what they are saying. Everyone knows what the lyrics to this song are so no big deal.	UC-uZ_L_6O6dIfGIrB45OF_w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-uZ_L_6O6dIfGIrB45OF_w	0

Imagine if someone stood here and sang about Iran or China in English? We would (I would) be telling them to get the F out! Instead they are holding America high and singing about the best land in the world. Singing it in another language is not as big of a deal as the people that do speak English and are stripping us of our Constitution and forcing dictatorship on us.

There are things we&#39;ve done &amp; are still doing that are contrary to the moral values I hold dear, but which country in the world do you believe is more moral, in which you would prefer to live? In how many other countries could we even have this open discussion? I wish all of you, conservative &amp; liberal, could be more tolerant, even accepting of one another &amp; our various views.

You are the racists.¬†The reality is, morons like you two, are PART of the reason why racism is still prevalent in many cultures. I enjoyed the video, and I agree with nearly everything West said. It&#39;s a video, with a song, it sounded good and brought a lot of different cultures together and still represented America (we can assume anyways, we don&#39;t technically know what was said unless you speak one of those specific languages). But if you are an immigrant in America, you should be speaking English as your PRIMARY language. People always want to represent their culture and where they are from, yet never stop to think, if your culture and country is so great... why are you in America and not living there? Represent where you are, and this video did a good job on representing where they are without breaking ties to their¬†cultural differences.

Jumping to the conclusion that people are racist for being mad it wasn&#39;t in English makes liberals look bad. A person can strongly support an English only society without being a racist. In Canada Quebec often pushes for a french only society in their province, but nobody calls them racist because that would be ridiculous. They are white, and us English folks are white. It has more to do with preservation of culture. Having a percentage of the population unable to speak with the rest of society is problematic and frustrating. I think it is perfectly reasonable to require folks to be fluent in the native language of the country before immigration because otherwise there are some serious problems with them finding work and being productive member&#39;s of society.¬†	UCT24TmUkRX8rDa6oiLA5cMQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCT24TmUkRX8rDa6oiLA5cMQ	0

I do believe in legal immigration. I find it impressive when such legal immigrants work hard to learn the national language, but their are caveats to this. you cant expect an 80 year old immigrant to command English in 5 years. each of our various cultures had a period of adjustment when we began to come here. learning the language was recognized as beneficial to all who endeavored to do business here. and so they did. but of late we see immigrants of a more xenophobic nature. I believe these are at the root of these fearful Americans. it doesn&#39;t mean they are justified, but if I were a 75 year old man who has seen his country change so much, it scares them, and scared people tend to be defensive. allow me to cite an example. I have a close friend. she hails from Iraq. I met her after she courageously divorced the husband who was a product of an arranged marriage, who would drink heavily and beat her daily. held a gun to her head. raped her dozens of times. threw her down a flight of stairs while pregnant, causing her to lose the baby. in any case, since she was married off at 16, she remained barefoot and pregnant for the better part of 15 years. she had always wanted to go to college as I found out from her as her nurse at the doctors office where she went. her condition required her to come to our office 3 times per week. at age 34 and having been in America for 20 years, I guessed that she had been here for 3 years given the quality of her English. to my surprise she said not only that she&#39;d been here for 20 years, but that I was the very first American she&#39;d come to know. WOW! how is that possible? i&#39;m certain that many Americans would settle down if our most recent immigrants would try a bit harder to trust that all Americans are not Devils, as my friend was told. just a thought.

I don't care what you say, our healthcare should NOT be run by the feds. Syria - Are you on crack? The moron wanted to go to war!! Jesus Christ are you that blind or that stupid? Serious question. You'd think obama would have the brain cells to realize that the middle east is a black hole in which nothing good has come out of. We've wasted trillions of dollars and have lost thousands of lives and the idiot STILL tried to convince everyone to go over there. Not to mention the russians have syria's back which meant we would've had to deal with them too.

To campaign for his democratic buddies who were ALREADY IN OFFICE by the way. And who got stuck with the bill, yeah me and you. The taxpayers. It's as if Air Force 1 is his personal jet.

(Their report found no conspiracy by the WH to hide anything, and that it was the CIA who initially said the violence was a result of that stupid YouTube anti-Muslim video, and, in fact, no one has disproved that the video was not, at least partly, to blame.)¬† The IRS?¬† Again, also not a WH scandal, as the findings, after months and months of investigations by Congress have revealed that a) the WH had nothing to do with the extra scrutiny of phony "social welfare organizations" fraudulent 501(c)(4) applications, b) it is the job of the IRS to fully vet the applications of organizations requesting tax exempt status, especially for groups whose very name boasts their aversion to paying taxes, c) the IRS ALSO targeted so-called Liberal and Progressive groups (an inconvenient FACT not ever disclosed on FNC or right-wing blogs), and d) the head of the IRS at the time of this phony scandal was a partisan Republican appointed by George W. Bush.¬† Fast & Furious?¬† Fast & Furious (also called "gunwalking") was a program that began in 2006 - 3 years BEFORE Obama - under George W. Bush. "Obamacare"?¬† What about it?¬† I think it's great that finally, someone did something to help make health insurance affordable to Americans.¬† It's not a perfect system, but it's better than what we had, and Conservatives should love it since the ACA is virtually identical to the Republican plan written by the health insurance industry and the Heritage Foundation during the Bush tenure.¬† The website is not Obamacare, and issues with the website don't mean it's a bad law.¬† And if you do some actual reading on the subject, you'll learn that the vast majority of the "cancelled policies" were either junk insurance OR policies that simply didn't meet the standards imposed by the ACA.¬† What FNC also won't tell its viewers is that even without the ACA, insurance companies are constantly changing their policies and ALWAYS raise their rates EVERY YEAR.¬† I don't care that Obama said "If you like your current plan, you can keep it."¬† That's not a scandal, it's not a crime, and those words ARE NOT why Obama was reelected. Syria?¬† What exactly do you think Obama did there?¬† The fact is, the Administration sent non-military, humanitarian aid to the rebels.¬† He DID NOT send guns to Al Qaeda, as Michele Bachmann continues to say on FNC.¬† Did not happen.¬† Not a scandal. NSA (not NASA)?¬† The NSA has been spying on Americans since the GOP-sponsored law, the USA Patriot Act of 2001 was signed by George W. Bush.¬† I think it's a horrible law and I'm disgusted that the Republican Congress gave these powers to the President.¬† But if you actually investigate what Snowden leaked, much of what the NSA did that is causing so much dustup happened prior to Obama - not all of it, of course - and you certainly can't blame Obama for using the powers given him by the Congress, even if they have "seller's remorse." Claiming that the words "Benghazi," "Obamacare," "NSA," "IRS," "Syria," are "FACTS not opinion" is just silly.¬† They're NEITHER, they're simply a dog whistle that Conservatives use to get the attention (and campaign contributions, and votes) of the ignorant and uninformed who don't know any of the details or background of ANY of these alleged scandals.¬† As far as the bugaboo of a "Liberal Media" saying good things about Obama... Seriously?¬† What color is the sky on your world?¬† If anything, they're harder on Obama than they were on Bush (that's an actual fact you can research if you like).¬† The only network that has a left-leaning bias is MSNBC, and they still report FACTS, not accusations and rumors and outright lies.¬† David, I doubt that you've made it to the end of this LONG response, but I hope someone has.¬† Nothing I've written here will change your mind because your beliefs are not based on facts.¬† However, a willingness to let the facts guide your beliefs is a sign of true intelligence.¬†	UC36VQNKk19r0xGTD206tpmA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC36VQNKk19r0xGTD206tpmA	1	UggwK68IVTVKiXgCoAEC	David James

You never question your own assumptions, nor fail to ascribe the worst motives to those you despise (and make no mistake, you DO despise them).<br /><br />Here&#39;s some actual scholarship that addresses the differences between what you perceive and what is actually true.<br /><br />From &quot;Why they wish the Right Left&quot; by Taranto in the WSJ, discussing recent comments by Cuomo and De Blasio suggesting that conservatives should be excluded from the state of NY and paraphrasing extensive research by Jonathon Haidt:<br /><br />&quot;Haidt reports on the following experiment: after determining whether someone is liberal or conservative, he then has each person answer the standard battery of questions as if he were the opposite ideology. So, he would ask a liberal to answer the questions as if he were a &quot;typical conservative&quot; and vice-versa. What he finds is quite striking: &quot;The results were clear and consistent. Moderates and conservatives were most accurate in their predictions, whether they were pretending to be liberals or conservatives. Liberals were the least accurate, especially those who describe themselves as &#39;very liberal.&#39; The biggest errors in the whole study came when liberals answered the Care and Fairness questions while pretending to be conservatives.&quot; In other words, moderates and conservatives can understand the liberal worldview and liberals are unable to relate to the conservative worldview, especially when it comes to questions of care and fairness.<br />In short, Haidt&#39;s research suggests that many liberals really do believe that conservatives are heartless bastards--or as a friend of mine once remarked, &quot;Conservatives think that liberals are good people with bad ideas, whereas liberals think conservatives are bad people&quot;--and very liberal people think that especially strongly. Haidt suggests that there is some truth to this.<br />Haidt has a theory that moral reasoning is driven by, as Zywicki writes, &quot;five key vectors or values of psychological morality: (1) care/harm, (2) fairness, (3) loyalty, (4) authority, and (5) sanctity.&quot; Haidt posits that &quot;conservative values are more overlapping than liberals--:conservatives have a &#39;thicker&#39; moral worldview that includes all five values, whereas liberals have a &#39;thinner&#39; view that rests on only two variables,&quot; in Zywicki&#39;s summary.<br /><br />Thus conservatives have a far greater capacity to understand the liberal worldview than vice versa--and, applying the theory to the case at hand, Cuomo and de Blasio are simply unable to overcome their own cognitive limits. . . ¬†.&quot; ¬† ¬†¬†	UCGhRlqOhc2FF0WsmGkQQHkQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGhRlqOhc2FF0WsmGkQQHkQ	0

That sounds like an awesome way to spend tax dollars.	UCudHEuDwVOcS0a1z49vkUJw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCudHEuDwVOcS0a1z49vkUJw	0

Language is one of the only things that unites the people of a given country, so it&#39;s an important aspect of any country.

What's your point? "It's about cultural identity." - Okay....whatever that means. If you think there is one "cultural identity" in the U.S. I'd love to hear you outline it. "Language is one of the only things that unites the people of a given country, so it's an important aspect of any country." - Sounds like armchair bullshit anthropology to me. I would actually argue that to react to the phenomena (speakers of other languages being a sizable part of a nation) the way you do seems pretty weak. It smacks of "we can't make it work unless everyone speaks the same language". "People who go to America should speak English, If they don't, it suggests that they prefer their own language." - Obviously the first part of this is just an assertion on your part. As for people "preferring" their own language. Yes, when a family or small community comes to the US, they tend to talk to each other in their own language, but your assertion that they're doing it because they don't like English is silly.¬† "Therefore their not really Americans and should be living in another country, the one that speaks the language they prefer over English." - Given the topic, I will go ahead and point out your misuse of "their". As to the assertion that people who speak other languages aren't really American, I know this isn't the most logical response, but fuck off. You sound like a fucking fascist with that shit. People who come here are allowed to speak whatever language they want. I'm sure they understand that life will be better for them here if they speak English, from a practical point, but how could you possibly even entertain the idea that somehow legally forcing people to speak a certain language would *ever* be constitutional? It's not a viable option, it'll never happen, so just get over it. This is about how we choose to respond to people speaking other languages. Responding to it the way you are advocating is weak. It is saying "No, we can't handle it, it's too hard, keep them out." I think we can handle it. It's not the first time it's come up, and we shouldn't be pussies about it.

I'd like to inform you that having multiple petitions actually decreases your chances of reaching your target number, as people will sign one and not notice the several others. Also, if anti-racist means anti-white, I'm quite concerned, because I had no idea that the fact that I'm Caucasian (of mostly English descent) meant that I'm supposed to be racist. I guess I'm going against what I was born to be here... I was never taught to have the superiority complex many were obviously taught to have. ¬† Africa is not just for the Africans... There's a whole section filled with white people who treat the natives of that land like crap, like just because they took over they're somehow superior. And you, sir, are doing the same thing. This is not a white country just because white people conquered the people of this land a few hundred years ago and treated them horribly. People thought the Vikings were vicious savages, but they never treated natives of this continent (who were here for thousands of years before they visited) as horribly as the English chose to. They traded with them peacefully, even teaching them some European languages so they could communicate with other foreigners who came in the future. Since they were considered savages themselves, they did not make such judgments about the Native Americans. Vikings accepted they were culturally different and respected that. It seems no matter where English, Spanish, and French people go in the world, however, some group within them believes they are superior before the country is even theirs, and they choose to steal it by force. My ancestors were immoral slave-drivers who sincerely thought they were superior to everyone and had the right to take from them. That doesn't make this country theirs. It makes them thieves and murderers, and it makes the Native Americans the rightful owners of this land. Also, though this may be a terrifying concept, there is evidence to suggest that the skin pigment that comes with the term "white" is not natural... If you go back far enough, the people we descended from were thought to not be pale-skinned. You just may learn someday, when genetics are advanced enough, that somewhere down the line you're related to tons of other races. I hope that you will choose to live a better life than the one you are living now if that happens rather than harm yourself due to the horror.¬†	UCtBOyu4euyDhKXcEgORjuJw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtBOyu4euyDhKXcEgORjuJw	1	UgiTUZFiicHDJ3gCoAEC	Edward E

That would be great to hear every single language in the ad but it wouldn't be possible. The language that for sure without a doubt should be in the ad is one of the Native languages. When showing the diversity of this country the Natives should always be notice because this is our home land. How often have you seen Natives involved in a big ad. Hardly ever and yet this is where we are from. Some people in this country even think we are all dead. That's what someone told my family when we visited NY. We are not all dead. We are still here. Native need to be seen in more ads of this magnitude more often than any other culture when talking about the diversity of the US.

In many areas of the US at that time English was NOT people's first language. In many areas of Pennsylvania a lot of people spoke German as a first language. *Almost all of them were wealthy white men of English descent. A lot of them believed white people who are not property-owners, not of English descent, or not men (that would include YOU too, dumbass) should not be allowed to vote. *They based the US Constitution partly on the Constitution of the Iroquois Confederacy (whose land they took by force, including other Indian land) and with wealth that was built partly from African slave labor. Of course they didn't allow those people a voice. *Though those people weren't allowed a political voice they DID help build this country and fought and died alongside white soldiers in every American war. One of the first fatalities in the Revolutionary War was a half-black/half-Native man (Crispus Attucks).¬† "Fuck off with your cultural marxist propaganda" 1) Marxism is a philosophy about property, dumbass. Not culture. 2) WTF did I anything I say have to do with culture? Or Marxism? Has to do with language and history.

It's not a parallel situation to someone who is coming here out of desperation or to find better opportunity. Your friends are most likely going over there as a conscious career choice or for the sheer experience of it. They'll be a lot better equipped and have more opportunity to actively study the language than most migrants. On a personal level, I do agree that it'd be great for people coming here to learn English in 5 years. And I'm confident that a lot of immigrants actually do manage it, and that an even bigger proportion would like to. As to your assertion that they don't have the "right" to stay in the US if they don't learn English in 5 years, I don't understand how we could constitutionally implement something to enforce this even if we did decide to, not to mention the huge bureaucratic expansion and headaches it would cause. How many thousands of people would have to be hired to develop a linguistic evaluation system, establish thresholds and evaluate every person who enters the US, track them down 5 years later, re-evaluate them and then initiate a deportation process? It's better to just accept the phenomena and try to be grown ups about it and not just throw our hands up and start throwing people out. That's cowardly and weak.

Canadian-white (anglo-saxon origins), British, European, etc. Yet they are 10x more accepting of their minority communities than the whole of America is, even in provinces like Alberta. America is finally waking up to its multi-cultural reality, but Canada has already entered the phase of interculturalism. Where not only have they accepted the many minorities in their borders, but they are also working together, towards a better good. And here in the states we have these hick, racist right-wing sons of bitches trying to push us backwards in time. The bible belt is nothing but dead-weight to this country. Fucking neanderthals.

"I don't think abandonment of culture is at the root of our founding. It's how they abandoned the old form of Government that is most important."¬† Precisely. Solid quote. Pretty much makes the commercial at least somewhat valid, no? A little bit of reversal there.¬† So if that's the more important thing, which America is said founded on, than simple things like the diversity in culture shouldn't be made an issue at all. Which is why said immigrants came here in the first place; to leave their government and start anew. Also, based on the cultural stir fry America became since day one, which happened and is ok until we deny it. It's history, right? The hate and decline is made by those who fail to recognize this, which causes problems. So, like the commercial stated, is that we are all from different backgrounds and go forth together as Americans with the same American spirit.¬† ¬†	UCdRuQPYkvAWs5PqQNuE8t7A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdRuQPYkvAWs5PqQNuE8t7A	1	UggC7WHpn3oeOngCoAEC	mustangkrillin

I was a bit worried you'd just keep attacking and actually address what I was trying to say. I'll discard all your attacks here. "Because I have actually had people tell me "you don't even have a real country." and "You have no culture." - I can feel what you're trying to say there... I get that point. Especially living abroad. However, we are a product of Western civilization. We have already abandoned culture as a civilization. That's what happened since the Renaissance / Industrial Revolution. There is a sense of culture in Europe, but that's based on the thousands of years of development in those countries. America is 238 years old. America was created on abandoning culture and leaving it to interpretation, being free from European religious beliefs. In fact, they removed the native population which had culture and made them conform to their beliefs. But even contrary to the direction America was going, our culture was obviously haphazardly "multicultural". You know, they went to Africa and put a bunch of slaves on ships and brought them here. They brought in Chinese to help build the West Coast. Japanese to help build Hawai'i. Jacked Hawai'i from the Hawai'ians. Mexicans... Well, who had Texas first? California? And then eventually came in to work? Polish even came through with the Germans, whom "retained" their culture to have it reflect the streets of Wisconsin and Illinois. Scots, Arabs, etc...¬† Sure, I think your argument is based on your life in Europe, because you live in a place that feels more cultural. That's fine. I live in Japan and have been here many years (city and rural), and I obviously know what that feels like. I've been here several times even. I'm not crying. Maybe your friend is a pussy, and one of those closed foreigners who won't experience culture. Because I'm adaptable. But living here shows me the true strength of what America is. It isn't Europe. It isn't Asia. It's a capable country. The only reason its divided is because the powers which once ruled America won't accept that its a changing country, which is it's core value. That's American culture.¬† I think if Americans would stop splitting themselves (like political powers do) and actually take a human approach to connecting cultures, this wouldn't be an issue. You do realize that white Americans were pretty shitty up until 50 years ago, by dividing Americans right? Based on skin-color, white vs. non-white. Us vs. them. Despite what America was founded on. This is recent history, ask a grandpa. It's as if some of those still alive just don't want to see that change, and that's part of the issue.¬† And by the way, it's a Coke advertisement...

You were the one who brought this discussion to me. I could say the same for your argument as well. Another fallacy: "You'd have to prove that that makes me a bigot to be offended that it was taken out of it's original language. That is the claim against me in this video, which you are clearly siding with." Never called you a bigot. Where did I side with the video? I'm pretty sure I'm able to react on the idea of the commercial outside of the TYT take on it. This just happens to be the medium. Please, direct me. I hate when people use the bigotry word too... You can take the I'm a victim of feeling like said username is calling me a bigot stick out of your ass anytime now. I think its silly. That's a happy word, because the idea of offense over this is silly. My argument only resides with people who think this is offense in different languages. If that's not you, carry on. If you think its offense due to a company using it to sell cola, sure, that's a plausible argument. I may disagree, but I might respect that idea.¬† Also, you're obviously entitled to an opinion. But the whole taking offense to a commercial with multiple languages is silly. That's pretty much it. It isn't even needed to be taken to any other level than just a commercial, and yet you took it there. Simply put: 1) Its a highly patriotic *American* song, not an official anthem, **used** in a commercial.¬† 2) It's translated in variety of different languages, to display American pride. Nobody else's. *American pride.* Our American pride. The America that was built on foreigners. You know, people who settled on someone's land, but ya know, it's ours now.¬† 3) It displays how awesome of a country we are. How fucking great we are. I'm not apologizing for our greatness. In fact, I think because we can come to a point of respect towards what makes us America, a simple commercial like this doesn't offend me at all.

Perhaps in 20 - 30 years that wont be true anymore. :/"¬† ^^ This ruined your argument as well. It's like you're complaining about the language changing, which has absolutely nothing to do with the song used in a commercial. Yes, English *is* the *DE FACTO LANGUAGE*. You don't need to bold that. It's already understood. In fact, countries across the world have us already beat. *EUROPEAN* countries can speak multiple languages. Asian countries... South American countries. Mexico even. But here you are in your one place in the world bitching about a commercial.¬† But seriously. *If you have a problem with Coca Cola using the song for commercial purposes of selling a soda, that's an almost worthy argument.* But people are complaining of language, which is the stupid idea proposed. I am American. I'm proud that in a country, with plenty of immigrants from around the world, we can come to a respectable place as a nation (in a fucking commercial to say the least), which boasts American pride in their first language and sends a beacon to others who hear our message of being an American in their language across the world. Your liberal vs. conservative logic is highly flawed, as this commercial is the most American commercial we have on American TV. Instead of being so divisive, maybe you could channel your American energy into sense of worthy "what can we do together" type energy.¬†	UCdRuQPYkvAWs5PqQNuE8t7A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdRuQPYkvAWs5PqQNuE8t7A	1	UggC7WHpn3oeOngCoAEC	mustangkrillin

They think everything , whole world and its affairs are about them. They are the center of universe. Do you know What I see from this commercial ? Admiration for America , its way of life , culture , admission , acceptence etc...Its willingness to assimilate but also let you free in culture , new immigrants willingness to be assimilated because they respect you. Singing in their native language whether they are US citizens or not can be seen as a compliment.<br /><br />Except US right wing pundits and their fans do not see that way. They have to review and summarize everything as offensive , threat and with deep resentment...From their perspective everything is about them ! American exceptionalism is really something !

And because non-white Americans are so underrepresented in media at times, of course it would be something heartwarming for them to see too. So, in a way, this was a bitchslap that was well taken by the good people at Fox News and any other "BUT WERE AMERICUNNNNN" types, who helped spread their awareness. And people who are multilingual in the States could feel their American pride through the languages. And for others who just ate nachos and didn't really give a fuck, it was ok. The beers were nice.

It clearly divides the views of racist white Republicans like Beck from reality - it portrays a multicultural picture of America, reflecting actual reality, and therefore is offensive to Beck and his ilk, because these people are vehemently not the &quot;reality based community.&quot; They thrive on lies and fantasy, and this ad presents a short glimpse of the reality of America, with many ethnicities and languages.<br /><br />They hate that, like they hated film clips of Iraq before the US invasion showing normal people who looked kind of like us.<br /><br />So, of course it offends them. They react with gut-level anger just like a delusional liar in a mental ward when presented with cold hard facts. No, sir, you are not actually Napoleon, here&#39;s the proof, etc. Followed by &quot;how dare you,&quot; etc. It&#39;s the same emotional reaction we see from Beck and pals.<br /><br />Also, Beck and dimwitted friends, a large percentage of the song IS in English. Also, no, it is not in fact the National Anthem. Or Christian. And it was written by a lesbian woman [Katharine Lee Bates (August 12, 1859 ‚Äì March 28, 1929)], you poor deluded right wing crackpots.

As far as 'Gay Rights' and hate crime laws. ¬†Our constitution guaranteed EVERYONE's rights from the get-go. ¬†The Emancipation Proclamation and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 shouldn't have even been necessary. ¬†Neither should any hate crime laws. ¬†Having said that, there is no foundation for granting legal status or benefits to gay couples for being 'married', or even for the government recognizing their union. ¬†Marriage, as an institution recognized by the government has several purposes, none of which can actually apply to a gay union. ¬†(And it's not even that I'm against gay people doing what they want and loving who they want, but I AM against the government changing the legal definition of marriage to include people to who these criteria do not apply. ¬†The purposes, or criteria that I speak of are first, the propagation of a balanced and/or growing population level, which is very important to any country, lest their populations dwindle to the point of experience a sort of atrophy and begin to fail as a nation, and second the rearing of those children in a healthy and positive environment. ¬†A child raised in a household where there are not both a mother AND a father is more likely to have problems in their adolescence that continue into their adulthood. ¬†Among those problems are a dramatically greater risk of drug and alcohol abuse, mental illness, suicide, poor educational performance, teen pregnancy, and criminality. The source for this information is: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Center for Health Statistics, Survey on Child Health, Washington, DC, 1993. ¬†There are other studies and more statistics, but this one is fairly credible and for the sake of time I choose to let you do your own research. ¬† ¬†	UCQwRU4sbhhWOWlmnWHVKWBw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQwRU4sbhhWOWlmnWHVKWBw	1	UgjMGIkKHTeNbXgCoAEC	Roger Engle
UgjMGIkKHTeNbXgCoAEC.7-H0Z7-Muxn7-L2NbQsKxS		0	2014-02-06 12:59:02	optifog	+Roger Engle¬†I want to address your argument about assimilation but I don't have time to address both that and the tangental criticism of Europe at once, so I'll respond to the latter first, and the rest soon... Despite the fact that we have more Muslims than you do, you *still* do worse than us on important measures of religious harm, because you have far more Christians, and more Christian fundamentalists, than we have Muslims. For example even though Muslims also like to mutilate their children, far more Americans than Europeans have their genitals agonisingly mutilated without anaesthetic, and as babies which is by far the cruelest, most painful time to do it when the foreskin's still attached like fingernails and pain sensitivity is much greater, because your Christian and Jewish populations are so large. A few European countries have come close to banning it for boys as well as just girls, which still seems to be a hundred years away for you. Far more Americans than Europeans reject the theory of evolution, even in the countries with the highest Muslim populations.¬†Far more Americans than Europeans oppose stem cell research. I've lived in the UK my whole life and travelled to other parts of Europe, and *nowhere* have I ever come across the ridiculous number of religious buildings that are found in the US. Churches litter your landscape, and they're filled with people celebrating how everyone else is going to hell every Sunday, whereas most of the relatively few religious buildings we have at least abandoned the hellfire for non-believers stuff and are just places for primarily the elderly to go and sing and organise tea parties. Attempted exorcisms of the mentally ill and homosexuals are unheard of. We are way ahead of you on gay rights, and not just marriage but far more important things like anti-discrimination laws covering them for employment and housing in the private as well as just public sector, which you aren't even discussing yet. Our hate crime legislation didn't leave LGBTs out for over a decade, as yours did. 1 in 4 LGBT teenagers whose parents find out in the US, report being kicked out of their homes and there are millions of kids living on your streets or in foster care because their Christian parents abused or abandoned them for being LGBT. Muslims do this too, but it still happens less frequently here because again, you have more Christians than we have Muslims. On so many measures, the fact that we have more Muslims has *not* meant that we're worse off than you on the religious front. The one religious harm we *do* suffer more from than you - terrorism - is not primarily due to our Muslim population either. Here in the UK, for example, thousands more have died due to Catholics and Protestants' acts of terrorism against each other from the remaining religious areas, than died in the 7/7 attacks, and no Muslim has come close to killing any of our leaders, as Christian terrorists have with King James I and Margaret Thatcher. In Europe as a whole, most of our terrorists are Christians with their religion being at least part of their motive, with Muslims causing only a fraction of the total terrorism-related deaths.

"Tell that to those countries of Europe in which most natives speak at least three languages fluently even if they've never travelled abroad!" ¬† Europe's a nice place, but I wouldn't want to live there. ¬†(And I have done so...) ¬†It's overloaded with Muslims, or as they are commonly called in some places in Europe, "Turks", that do the same things I just spoke of above. ¬†In England, parts of France, Antwerp and Brussels, Mohamed, (with its various spelling variations), is the most common baby name given by the parents. ¬† Your precious Europe is being overridden with immigrants that think of themselves as invaders and conquerors. ¬†If you are to foolish to recognize that then who are you to talk to me about the way I try to defend my own culture?

You really think *this ad* is about that? On what basis do you interpret it that way? They're singing America the Beautiful, so clearly they're being represented as embracing America as an ideal, not just something they can get material gain from. In that context, don't you think it makes a lot more sense that the the different languages were used as a nice little way to indicate that they're from all around the world, *not* to indicate that they are in any way rejecting American culture? Do you really think that being able to speak a language that's not the dominant language in the country you live in, is a sign of not embracing the culture of the country you live in? Tell that to those countries of Europe in which most natives speak at least three languages fluently even if they've never travelled abroad! Even the *French* consider functional English to be a basic educational standard, even though many of them don't like us English very much and pretend they can't speak it when we travel there, lol: /watch?v=rxUm-2x-2dM Although we're very poor at it and take it less seriously as the practical benefits are weaker for us, the English and other British countries likewise teach French as a compulsory subject until the age of 14. Bilingualism was the norm for the most educated classes even throughout the periods we were at war, without anyone taking it as a sign of treachery. If even *we* speak each others' languages without resentment, why on Earth would other languages be offensive in a country that hasn't even got a negative history with the countries those languages are from, in most cases?¬† If you can speak a language that isn't the dominant language in your country - which is the norm in many countries - do you think that you're obligated to decide to *never* speak that language again, so that you and your children will lose that valuable skill of bilingualism? Isn't that a huge sign of insecurity, to feel threatened by anyone thinking other languages are worth being able to speak, and not deliberately forgetting the ones they know? English is thriving in the world, there's no reason to feel so insecure about its status that hearing other languages feels like hearing it attacked.

We can&#39;t have millions and millions of people unemployed and getting benefits simply because they immigrated and we let EVERYONE in. ¬†¬†	UC2LTBICnb8QKsnTfwXKE1BQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2LTBICnb8QKsnTfwXKE1BQ	0

There are Spanish channels, signs have multiple different languages on them...mainly Spanish. Everything is being adopted to use two, three and even four different languages. If everyone could speak a single language this wouldn't be necessary. However, the fact is that the language of America is slowly, very slowly, changing. I want to prevent that change. Making English a requirement to learn if you want full citizenship should be implemented. Don't get me wrong, It's not that i dislike other languages, i just don't think that we, as a nation, should cater to people who want IN to the country. Onto the jobs. You are correct, many ILLEGAL immigrants take up jobs Americans will never fill (at least at the current pay) however, im talking about legal ones. Its a fact that immigrants tend to stall economies, with the exception being in booming times when jobs are plentiful and more labor is needed. We are not in those times. We keep piling in more and more people that we, as a nation, simply are unable to care for. Again, i draw attention to the fact that people think we should make all illegals CITIZENS of the USA...does anyone think past their own moral high-horse? With programs strained, education declining and debut plentiful we cant afford to simply be willy-nilly about immigration and citizenship. The USA political system is fucked, and until we fix it i think we owe it to people to severely limit immigration so we can get America back on track. However, I'm sure the most people on the left would never think of doing such a thing, because that would stop the red states from turning, ever so slowly, to blue.

Regarding the issue of immigrants, the big question is whether Americans are willing to do the jobs that immigrants usually do. True, illegal immigration should be limited, and I don't think anyone expects USA to take care of every poor person in the world (though it seems to act like it wants to), but are Americans capable of working in jobs such as house keeping, which are often associated with immigrant workers? For example, in The Netherlands, Dutch people work in garbage disposal and window cleaning, which might be considered as mundane 'unimportant' work, but seen from the Dutch perspective are just as important as doctors and politicians, and are respected by Dutch people just like any other job	UCsBK-0UlDGdREBy8gvaE66g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsBK-0UlDGdREBy8gvaE66g	1	Ugj84AXcLK_VsHgCoAEC	12myersjonathan

I believe that they made this AD to show all different people can enjoy Coke and All of US should work together as Americans and not against each other. If you want to get technical All of should not really be here. The reason why is the American Indians were here before all of our white ancestors settled here. We took someone's land and put them on a small asseveration and entrapped them. So when we say other people don't belong here we should look and say we shouldn't be here ether.

The reason conservatives, or really anyone who loves American culture, hates this commercial,¬†IS because it advocates multiculturalism. This is not the same as the natural¬†harmony of¬†races under one nation and accepting their national brotherhood, but a purely political attempt at forming a nation of many unassimilated, clashing cultures. Our language and our cultural heritage in the United States is Anglo-Celtic, just as is our governing structure. While we may have citizens of many races, they have no right to influence our culture in that way, just as we have no right to influence theirs in their country of origin. Stop mixing the terms race and culture; one may initially define the other, but culture can be accepted by individuals (not collectives) of another race. Many Black Americans (as well as¬†White right-wing douchebags¬†like me) such as Colonel Allen West understand exactly what I mean. I'll bet you'll find a good many older African Americans who also would agree with me. Multiculturalism by definition divides politically, socially, and culturally. It is a form of factionalism that our Founding Fathers would have abhorred. The purpose of such an ideology is national suicide. Our Melting Pot is not a multiculturalism; it is complete and definitive acceptance of American culture and language by those of anyone who seeks to become a citizen. It is the recognition that our culture is BETTER than all others. Yeah, I said it.¬†Our culture¬†is not equal to that of the¬†Hispanics, Turks and Somalis. There is no such thing as equality of culture. Cultures are and ought to be unique to their respective nations.

I wonder what percentage of Americans realize the musical score for, "America the Beautiful," was based on the UK anthem, "God save the Queen"? As for the commercial itself, I found it to be beautiful and something I have witnessed - regarding cultural acceptance - in many other countries around the world. Sadly, due to right wing religious nut-jobs, in America, it could never be a reality.¬† To these nut-jobs who hated this commercial: Many many years ago a man said people should love each other - regardless of culture or race; to accept those who are not like you; to help those less fortunate; to walk away from people who are hateful or have lechery or malice in their hearts; to heal the sick and feed and cloth the poor... Who was this man? Read those bibles you are so busy thumping... You will soon discover, it is the mortal enemy to your cause and hypocrisy: Jesus.

I am gentleman in training by day, and in youTube comments, an immature but maturing harlequin. Maybe if there is an afterlife, I can become a trickster god. I appreciate you attempt to write slow. The way some people write its like listening to a thick brogue. No, I have seen women wearing small tents they call a burqa. Some even have a mosquito net in front of the face. I knew at least one women who had to wear one stationed overseas. I also know that women in service at one time were required to wear them, but the men were not held to the same dress requirements. You can be punished for failing to do as you are told, but I do admit to a difference. I have heard that if women do not do as they are told in dress 'requirements', the punishment can be severe. Are the youTube videos of Muslim 'fashion police' flogging women a misrepresentation? The Bible also has some dress codes, and many schools in Britain and the USA require school uniforms. I assumed you lived in America, and was pointing out that the government, if it is telling you how to act, is probably based on social norms, for safety reasons, for security reasons, or because you are acting in a unsocial like way. I was also a bit sensitive because at the time I was rebutting a Christian because he seemed to think he would be forced to bake a cake for a gay. And lastly, I knew who you were referring to, or at least could assume you were posing a straw man version of me since you at least opened with a quote mark.

They just wanted to be good little traditionalists while being utterly dismissive of history, it&#39;s realities and consequences and the world around them which they solidified, which is to this day being maintained by people of different ethnic groups whom should enjoy the right to be proud and express the pride of their origins, while effortlessly making themselves look like ignoramuses and bigots.

The other thing I legitimately find perplexing is the appeal to "traditional values" by social conservatives in this country.¬† In a lot of ways, it's a fiction.¬† If you go back 100 years, it would have been contentious based on traditional values to allow women to vote.¬† Go back 150 years or so, and people couldn't agree on whether or not certain people could be the property of others.¬† This includes the respective religious institutions of the day. Beyond that, it's most perplexing when the appeal is to traditions started by the Founders.¬† If you want to pick a group that was against doing things solely on tradition, it would have to be them.¬† They based many of their notions based on the scientific, philosophical, and logical facts and arguments of the day. If they had appealed to tradition, we would be all subjects of the crown still.

If Native Americans or others were singing the song in some Native American languages, would it be offensive? After all, those are the actual Americans and it's a song about the land of America. Or do they get a pass? English is a language that immigrated from England. It's no different that the other languages that immigrated here from Europe. The only difference is that it became the most popular language here and people are intolerant of diversity in a way that might is right.

If you're going to live in a "bible belt" state though don't let people know you're atheist b/c then they'll hate you for not being Christian (they won't try to kill you but they might disrespect you and make your life difficult). If you're name sounds arabic you might want to consider changing it but you might not need to if it's not too difficult for english speakers to pronounce. Good luck!

Shoving unscientific ideologies down the throat of innocent children who can't defend themselves even more so. Education used to be a human right! But now, not only in the U.S., but everywhere in the world, education has been degraded to a good and it's disgusting. Education for the sake of education, and not for the sake to fill the pockets of someone else. The problem is, those who have enough money to have a say in education policies, don't want students, and by default everyone to think critically. They all want us to bow down to their nonexistent power. If only we could stop caring too much about money, and start to really care about ourselves and our fellow human beings. Then, maybe then we might actually get to make some real progress in this world. Critical thinking is crucial for our progress.

Second, you no longer see people bragging about how they hold the moral high ground due to their dislike of slavery, right? The fact that Coca Cola was making a big deal out of their own inclusiveness (the first point notwithstanding) drives home the fact that the same is not yet true of multiculturalism - I hate that it&#39;s not simply assumed (by society in general) to be a part of basic human decency.

Think about how weird it would be if the message of the ad was changed to "stoning your children to death for talking back to you is immoral." You'd think, "um, yeah, we all already knew that, thanks." That's how I feel when the message is support of multiculturalism.

I&#39;m more upset w/ the right wing for making a stink about that &quot;us soldier married to muslim woman&quot; sleeping aid ad. I mean, that ad was stupid/trying too hard too but their reaction was just acidic and ridiculous.¬†<br /><br />The legitimate problem that right wingers have w/ &quot;multi-culturalism&quot; is when they look at Europe, and they see hardline anti-everybody else Muslims who make &quot;no-go zones&quot; in those countries, view non-Muslim girls as women who are just there to be raped, instill Sharia marriage courts so that there are different laws for Muslims etc. That&#39;s what they don&#39;t like, when you have the idea of &quot;multi-culturalism&quot; and fundamentalis Muslims and/or Christians what you have is a bunch of religious nuts trying to push their religious bullshit onto everyone else, so instead of &quot;a big melting pot&quot; you just have a bunch of little pots all separate next to each other. Multi-culturalism just cannot work when fundamentalists are involved. But that&#39;s just the right wing way of judging a whole group by their worst possible fringe elements (which is easy to do b/c the reasonable non-fringe ones don&#39;t push back very hard against the crazies making them look bad)	UCkOj7XTcoS1Zblqf5QPw7jw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkOj7XTcoS1Zblqf5QPw7jw	0

There are so many Cuban immigrants there that it's kind of a Little Cuba down there. Most get by, businesses have mostly Spanish speaking patrons, and most of them do learn some English basics anyways. I agree in general that immigrants should learn some English though. It's very presumptuous to move to another country and not speak the native language. I wouldn't expatriate to Spain and not bother to study their language beforehand.

The commercial was there for one purpose, to sell Coke. I highly doubt they wanted to make the commercial for the purpose of that video, they wanted to sell coke.

Why do you think all the various ethnic groups that immigrated to the US en masse in the late 19th and early-to-mid 20th century, who most certainly faced discrimination and ethnic slurs while working low-wages jobs... how exactly do you think they came to be accepted and amalgamated rather seamlessly into the fabric of American society?? Aside from the fact that in those days you had to prove you were bringing a net positive to the nation -- no safety nets and benefits programs; just opportunity for those willing to work hard for the sake of their descendents -- a major factor in such non-Anglo migrant ethnic groups becoming fully assimilated into American society, and were eventually regarded as "fellow Americans" by the Anglo-Saxon majority, was that immigrants from that era made it a point to learn the language of the host nation accepting them. Language can be the glue that binds a multicultural nation while every group retains the human right to retain their own culture/customs and native tongue, and not just in their own respective households either. The unfortunate fact is that the massive level of immigration has made it such that entire regions, and/or pocketed communities within urban centers, *don't have the same kind of motivation to learn English as past waves of immigrants* simply because they do not need to learn English to get by in their daily lives. This leads to areas where a foreign language becomes the primary language... a fractured society divided along ethnic and cultural lines (more so because of language barriers) and this is not exactly conducive to helping bind the masses into one collective, it is something that leads to resentment. Before you tell me that there is no official language in America -- which is an intellectually dishonest way to argue for a quasi-Balkanization within large American cities -- i might add that it is fairly obvious to any objective person, just as it was to the ancestors of non-Anglo naturalized citizens, that English is the de-facto language of the United States. All the Founding Documents of the American nation, and all of its laws are written in English. All of our legislative and executive governing bodies conduct their sessions/speeches in English.¬† And the majority of 2nd, 3rd, 4th generation Americans speak English. Language is more important in the collective fabric of any society than you are giving it credit for.¬† People are and ought to be free to speak whatever language they choose in or our of their homes... but in becoming a part of this great nation (which is quite a privilege, i shouldn't have to add), i believe immigrants should at least try learning *some degree* of fluency in English. That is my opinion, i am only speaking for myself here.¬† But do we really want a society where every phone call is "press one for English, press two for Spanish, press three.... all the way up to press nine for ____"??? To me, that is a dividing factor in society and only makes the right-wing more wary of immigration, especially given the tough economic factors of today and the fact that legal American citizens are struggling badly on the whole.

I already said, speaking other languages is fine, but especially in a multicultural society there has to be some sort of "glue to bind" the various cultures/races/ethnic groups... and that has to be language.¬† Citizens of a nation should at least *KNOW* a common language, even if they don't use it often. Society will eventually fracture when times get tough if there is no binding factor, just all separate parts.

Sometimes it seems like &quot;rechristicons&quot; only exist to give rationalists a good, almost daily laugh. At other times it seems like &quot;rechristicons&quot; only exist to make us embarrassed to members of the same species. However, let us not forget 60,933,500 Americans voted &quot;rechristicon&quot; in 2012 and they currently hold 45 or 100 seats in the senate. It&#39;s true that &quot;rechristicons&quot; make reasonable people think of the oompa loompa song, but don&#39;t laugh too hard or for too long. The marching song going though the minds of the &quot;rechristicons&quot; is far darker, more hate filled and more ominous than you can possibly imagine. A quick heads-up for the wing-nut group -- FYI the song in the Coke commercial was not the American Anthem, it was just a song about America.

And no, I am not right wing. But she is simply wrong for thinking they are all this way. Even if most are, that doesn&#39;t mean all are. THey are generalizing a whole group of people, which is exactly what they took issue with when one of the commenter associated all the people in the ad as illegals. And Cenk says &quot;how dare they include noi-white&quot; as if only whites are complaining: but then the first guy they quote &quot;Allen West&quot; is black.

Several of Coke&#39;s top executives in¬†Germany¬†were public members of the¬†NSDAP¬†(Nazi Party). When the United States entered World War II, Coke began to represent its product in the US as a patriotic drink by providing free drinks for soldiers of the¬†United States Army, thus allowing the company to be exempt from sugar rationing.

Not to mention that there was never a single verbal or written language in this country before English settlers.<br /><br />True Americans speak a language conceived in a European island nation that always supported our democratic culture.

The original colonies were founded in the 17th century by England yes, but the first one, Jamestown, was named after the Scottish king, James, that also took the throne of England as well as Scotland. The monarchy after that were Kings and Queens of two countries. By the American Rebellion/Revolutionary War of Independence, England and Scotland had already joined to unite the island of Britain and combined everything, so the Americans were fighting all of Britain, not just England. After the union the monarchy is known as the King or Queen of Great Britain and now King or Queen of the UK (United Kingdom). The Scottish King made London the capital when the Kingdom's united because it's an obvious choice as the largest city and the government has both Scottish and English representatives, as well as those from Wales and Northern Ireland.

Personally, I thought the ad was beautiful and a great display of multiculturalism, and I don‚Äôt believe anyone should be offended by it, but everyone has a right to their own opinion. However, if you are going to argue that this ad was ‚Äúun-American‚Äù please use the following guidelines so you don‚Äôt sound like a complete dumbass:<br />¬∑ The song used was America, The Beautiful, NOT God Bless America or the Star-Spangled Banner<br />¬∑ America, The Beautiful is not our national anthem<br />¬∑ In the United States of America, the most common language is English not American<br />¬∑ The United States of America does not officially have a language that is federally recognized<br />o Certain states legally recognize languages other than English (French and Spanish are common) but still no language is legally recognized on a federal level<br />¬∑ Use proper grammar (there is a difference between your and you‚Äôre and what they mean)<br /> 	UC9PN7KLS5bzVp8Bg1LUsrhg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9PN7KLS5bzVp8Bg1LUsrhg	0

On one hand I love multiculturalism being Black myself and expect every race, creed, and culture to be accepted within the limits of the law. Shit I prefer Asian Cinema to American Cinema because it seems we ran out of ideas but that&#39;s another discussion. However I can admit that its irritating sometimes dealing with people who don&#39;t know how to speak English and refuse to learn how. And there&#39;s more of them every day given jobs where customer service is key like in the food industry. So yes it should be a requirement to learn how to speak English especially if they&#39;re going to deal with the public who don&#39;t know how to speak Spanish, Chinese, Swahili whatever.

They speak broken English at best or at worst they have them working in the kitchen with literally no knowledge of the English language. The problem with that is I used to work for them and the orders pop up on the screen in the kitchen when its put into the POS. Since the people in the back can't read it in its entirety they just fuck it up almost every time. We used to get at least 10 complaints a day when I worked there. They literally had instructions for everything in both English and Spanish and in that lays the problem. We coddle them to the point where its not necessary to learn. Command prompts for customer service is in both English and Spanish. Social Workers for benefits speak both English and Spanish. Instructions for shit you buy comes in English and Spanish.

Not Spanish, not French, not Japanese. I shouldn't have to learn another language just to order a cheeseburger in my own country which I just had to do recently since all the Mcdonald's and Burger Kings in my area are staffed with Hispanics so I literally had to learn Spanish just to get my burger the way I wanted it. That's ridiculous and counter productive. Thus why we say it should be a rule that in order to gain citizenship you must know how to speak English proficiently.

Which there isn't anything wrong with per say, but why aren't they proud enough to sing in english? Well, because we want to teach people that immigrants who cant speak english are a-okay even through studies show that immigrants who CANT speak the national language (I don't care what the fed says its what everybody speaks so its the national language same as everyfuckwhere else in the country. The fed says marijuana is illegal but we all know thats wrong) of the country the immigrate to not only stay as poor or get poorer than they were in the country they came from (the point of immigrating is to improve your life, right? whats the point if another countries poor just because ours? We have enough poor as it is!) but they are also more likely to become criminals. Another important question, why weren't any of the european languages? There cant be any german/french/welsh/russian immigrants? Why is it only the languages spoken by "brown" people? Because progressive teach us we NEED more "brown people" because we NEED diversity and white people aren't diverse enough (either that or we are simply evil) So, if they sung with heavy accents, but still spoke english, I wouldn't have had an issue no matter what language was sung. If they sung in different languages, but sung in MORE languages, I would still be annoyed, but no longer be upset. But they way they made the commercial, combined with the rhetoric of "progressives" means coca cola supports opening up our borders specifically to the local foreigners. (even then canadians are excluded because I didn't here quebec french, only the type of french they speak in haiti) So again, why are they so racist to exclude so many white foreign languages from the song?

America has been a melting pot for a long time and people really have to get used to it. Theres soo many immigrants in Canada and do I care? No because I dont know them and they dont affect my life. would I get angry if people were singing the national anthem in different languages? No because they are Canadian too, and alot of them were BORN here. So who cares? Americans are fucked lol. "Should we go down to mexico and force them to speak mandarin?" what is that even suppose to mean? No ones forcing Americans to speak other languages...

Neither political party actually gives a shit about minorities, they care about their own power, they don&#39;t care what colour the back is they stand on to get it.<br />Its sociopathic political bastards exploiting the rest of society for their own narrow agendas and personal gain on all sides.<br />This is why people are vastly more tolerant of the crack smoking mayor, because at the end of the day they think, well at least he&#39;s honest, unlike the rest of them.

"These words are used to describe" Then why is their descriptive power seemingly absent, you know about as descriptively useful as the word 'spiritual' is. "I believe Right-wingers, on average, are more racist than Left-wingers." I believe right wingers and left wingers are exactly the same thing merely hiding behind ambiguous labels which have next to no descriptive merit. I view them as the same, why do you believe them to be different, is it a generalisation, a preference for people who share your views (a confirmation bias) or do you have demonstrable scientific knowledge in this area? (real science please not carefully constructed surveys which can show whatever you want them to, there is a reason they have to call themselves 'social sciences') Keep in mind the label of what is 'right wing' or 'left wing' can be adjusted seemingly endlessly. Do we count the labour party, or are they too centre? Do we only count communists on the left? I mean what percentage do you consider to be wing? 5%? To me it looks like meaningless babble, people pick a colour hat and then espouse whatever views they believe will maximise their power.

These words are used to describe the ideals that line up with each individual's personal sense of progress, justice and morality, so they apply to average people with opinions as well. While most politicians from all over the spectrum do not care about minorities, as far as average people are concerned, I believe Right-wingers, on average, are more racist than Left-wingers.

I love having new pieces of information brought to me. What you have brought to me is evidence. So, I am a man of my word. I was wrong and I apologize. HOWEVER. You saying to go to an autistic place is foolish. I could do the same and send you to an area even worse than me, but I won't. It is easy to throw someone to the wolves you ally yourself to. It is actually harder to debate with someone one on one. So, in that instance, you are the one in the wrong for doing that. It is fine though, you don't even feel like you have to apologize. Lastly, (believe it or not, I really) don't care, I was the one in high school that defended people like you from actual bullies, so please do not pretend you know me from this brief exchange. In closing this once and for all, I am a big enough man to admit he was wrong, so once again I was wrong and I apologize.

You perpetuate a myth about autism being a bad thing, and autistic people struggle to find work, or make new friends, or hold down relationships, because people think autism is a bad thing. One girl broke up with me because she was afraid of having autistic kids. It's a personal tale of woe that I won't go into detail over, but it demonstrates why attaching negative connotations to autism isn't doing autistic people any favours. And to be perfectly honest, calling someone 'autistic' ¬†as a derogatory when they're not is, indeed, about as primary school you can go on the maturity scale.¬† But, you want evidence of how it harms autistic people in the community in general? Why don't you try repeating what you said amongst other autistic people? https://www.facebook.com/AutisticChick Why don't you try going in there and telling them that you think Beck is autistic by virtue of being 'retarded' or stupid, and see how you fair. There are plenty of scholarly articles on the topic that if you were being honest, you'd look up yourself. You might start with the Cochrane journal, it covers the topic in great detail. But you're not being honest, you're being lazy, and like most lazy people, you'd rather I just go away than actually work this out. You'd rather cling to your preconceptions and what you believe are 'ideals' then consider the possibility that you're wrong. Because that possibility comes with too much work figuring out where you went wrong, and why. Well, I've already reduced that work for you by telling you where and why. You don't have to believe me. Of course, you don't want to believe me, because you're too lazy for that. You'll be too lazy to visit your 'ideals' on a group of autistic people as well. One on one is easy for you, but having a whole group shut you down? That would be too much work. Too much humiliation. Well, maybe what you need is a taste of humiliation. Do you have any idea how humiliating it is for autistic people to be told they're offspring isn't wanted because they're afraid? It's why they're afraid that's the problem, and you're helping to perpetuate it. You are wrong, and if you were to consider the possibility that you were wrong, you wouldn't need me to give you hard evidence, you'd go and look for it yourself. Especially if you were being honest. But you're not, you're just a lazy dick looking to cause drama on the internet because even outside is too much effort for you. http://healthland.time.com/2012/09/05/why-autistic-kids-make-easy-targets-for-school-bullies/ You're just another school bully really. I'm thirty now, but back in ninth grade, I started standing up to the likes of you, overcame my own fear. It broke me in a sense but it also made me a little more dangerous to the bullies. Especially when I realised they were always more afraid of me, and that was the real cause of the bullying to begin with. Autistic people are everywhere, and usually, they are much smarter than others. Are you keeping us down because you're afraid we'll exceed what neurotypical humans are capable of? We've already done that. You have no idea how much of the world we live in, the computers and technology, is the result of the mind of an autistic savant.

Pure and simple. As for me getting pissed, I'm not. I don't know you, so I obviously wouldn't care enough about you to let you piss me off. You, however seem do pissed by my comment that you are continuing to respond. It is pathetic. Some big long speech about how I am just evil incarnate doesn't make you look better, it makes look desperate. "Blaming the victim"? Yeah, that only works in some cases, this is not one. You are not a victim, you never were in this exchange. You are just trying to justify your actions by using that, which is even worse than pathetic. Quit trying to win sympathy votes by calling yourself a victim. A victim is someone who was raped, murdered, mugged, or bullied in school (no, cyber bullying does not count). Yet here you are lumping yourself in with that just so people will side with you. That makes you a worse person than even me! I have made it perfectly clear that I'm not going to stop saying something just because it offends certain people. So, why continue? Does it really make you that big of a person to keep going. If that's the case, then I pity you. You are seriously in need of a life. Please go find one before you get so pissed of by random assholes like me that you end up doing something stupid.

The problem is, autistic people are frequently misunderstood as 'bad' people, but the truth is, they're just different. The bad people are actually the ones perpetuating the myth that autism is bad. You aren't just childish and ignorant, you are bad in general. By turning autism into derogatory invective, you equate it with a badness in someone, in which case you assist in the perpetuation of the myth that autism is bad. That's how you belittle it. It's got nothing to do with whether we let you or not, because as you can see, I was actually trying to stop you with my initial comment. Should I just ignore it, lie down and take it as if it isn't a problem? As if it's not offensive? I'm not going to push the x just to get rid of you, no, I'm going to call you out on it. And then, you're going to get all defensive about it and blame me as if I'm the bad guy, and attempt to make me feel bad about it. If you were being honest, you'd be admitting you were in the wrong, and apologising. But like all SA whelps and keyboard 'warriors' alike, typical bullies, you don't like being stood up to. How about I just keep standing up to you then, keep calling you out, because it's clearly pissing you off. I believe that would be called a taste of your own medicine. No, you're not being honest. I would be surprised if you had any ideals beyond "how offensive can I be today and who can I blame for it other than me?"

By referring to him as either, you belittle both. You started the slinging by making said references. Additionally, if I was able to interpret what you said the way I did, then perhaps your wording could be better as well. You see no correlation between the statement you made about the difference between me and Beck and the comparison to retardation? Read it again.¬† Whether I'm 'butthurt' or not is beside the point. Attempting to make me more 'butthurt' by repeatedly referring to me as such highlights your vindictive nature. I suggest you take a valium, calm down, then try learning something about autism, retardation, better word use and less antagonistic communication methods. If you're an arse on the internet, you're still an arse. The internet doesn't save you from that. "My argument has not been negated by you, and that bothers you" I'm well aware of that and it doesn't bother me at all. It does, however, make you an arse incapable of understanding. Perhaps you are a bit autistic yourself with that lack of empathy showing through and the strong defensiveness of your arse-ish position.¬†	UCwzp1KSVvMZQNKTk8dMRAFg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwzp1KSVvMZQNKTk8dMRAFg	1	Ugh3dDTCW_68EXgCoAEC	Zarion Wildclaw

Second I was using retardation as a different example. Yes, I am very well aware autism and retardation are different. The only real thing I was implying was that Beck was autistic AND retarded. There is no evidence that says I would imply anything other than that. Lastly, I do understand retardation (either being born with it or through some kind of traumatic accident). You seem to be the only one making assumptions in this conversation, I'm only making observational comments based on the facts presented to me. If you are actually doing the same, then might I suggest rewording you statements. Now if you want some assumption, here is one. I assume you are actually butthurt. Not completely by words anymore, but on how my stand point has not wavered at all. My argument has not been negated by you, and that bothers you. If I'm wrong, well that is way I try not to assume too much. One last thing, you started the insults, so don't get pissed because I sling them back.

Example. There are people born with a retardation, then there are people like Beck who were born and are now retarded." Those were your words. You said there was a difference between me and him, and provided an example. That example specified Beck as developing a retardation, leaving the difference, me, as the one born with a retardation, after autism was specifically referenced. After I told you I am autistic, without insulting you in any way. The interpretation of what you wrote is you insinuating that I was born retarded, knowing full well I am autistic. There was no assumption made, I deduced your meaning based on your own words. If you think, however, that I took offence from meaningless words, you would be, again, mistaken. I was merely pointing out their meaninglessness, and your insistence on using the word retard in any way without understanding it makes you a moron. In fact, your continued mistakes only compound the evidence against you that you are, indeed, a moron.¬†Not because you typed too much. Also, please note, 'your' implies ownership, ie 'your car is crap'. 'You're' is a compound of 'you are' and it is what you use when you say 'you're an idiot'. So if you're going to call someone an idiot, try not to make your own lack of brain capacity clear to everyone reading.

Yes, we evolved in Africa somewhere and migrated across a bridge of ice between Russia and Alaska, yadayadayada. The point that you keep fruitlessly rebutting against is that some respect is due to the "indigenous" people because they have had their land stolen from them and their culture raped and then ignored ever since colonialism reached North America. It's disgusting. It really is. The difference between "indigenous" people being immigrants and Americans being immigrants is that when the "natives" migrated to North America, it was uninhabited and theirs for the taking. They were the first people of that land, and as such, it's easy to see why people often claim they are the original "Americans", don't you think?

They know that soft drinks isn¬¥t what people really want. People are searching for human closeness and feelings of unity. That is what makes us happy. The soda is made by people but as soon as it is shipped from the factory and on to the shelf of your local store, all of the human values are stripped from it.

It would have been a better choice to have them singing <i>I&#39;d Like to Buy the World A Coke</i> song, so it would be more apt to have each nationality singing in their own language.<br /><br />I also have a feeling that the CEO of Coca-Cola speaks English, despite his Turkish heritage.

Many men come here with their families and the women hardly ever learn german. It's an easy trick, keep them from learning it, they won't run away or behave 'horrible' like those german women. If they can't speak the language, who would they go to? I wouldn't go to a country when I don't know the language or I would try to learn it. You simply need it, wether it be for a good job, official things or simply to help your children learn the language from early on so they'll have it easier.

I said that I support multiculturalism but that it's naive to think that it is easy. So where's the propaganda? And both things I mentioned have been up and down the German press. They are easy to verify. So what about it is "no good evidence"? Truth is, every single civil war is a multiculturalism story gone bad. Just being in the same country is not enough. Different people have to work on becoming one society with a common core. Otherwise it's just a powder keg waiting for the spark. Just look at the Serbs and the Croats. They are actually culturally similar, they have lived in the same country for 50 years and then...massgraves. I am for multiculturalism but we have to make sure that we form a new society that is made up of all the small parts that each group brings along with a common core of fundamental principles, not live in different sub-societies in the same country and are so tolerant of each other that we never address those things that hold us apart.

How do you "interact with and learn from people with different backgrounds" if they do not speak your language? Another thing is that you have to agree about certain non-negotiable core values. Here in Germany we have some problems with immigrants from Turkey who have a patriarchal mindset and refuse to let their daughters get an education. They claim cultural background as their defense when challenged about that. It got so ridiculous, a couple years ago a Moroccan guy beat his wife into the hospital and when he was arrested he claimed that it was a matter of religious and cultural freedom, citing the Quran and the laws of his home country in court. The judge's verdict was "not guilty". Multiculturalism is great but it's not without difficulties and unless we agree on certain non-negotiable elements, among those the core values of our culture and a common language as the basis of real communication and exchange, it is doomed to fail.

We&#39;re not as great as we were when it was just black and whites living here. I have no problem with blacks living here, because they worked here as slaves, their retribution should be their freedom here in America, but mass immigration is fucking this place up. Why is it, any other country gets to be strict about their immigration laws, but America has to be the mass dick hole getting slammed since the early 1900&#39;s from immigration?

Which led to a discussion where I ended up having to remind her about the Cheerios backlash by showing her some videos from last week about the new one.

I do feel that it is advantageous for all Americans to learn the English language, both for them and us. Don&#39;t worry about boycotting coke, they don&#39;t have any trouble selling their product all over the world, even in Central America and South America. Interesting side note; the other &#39;melting pot&#39; country in our hemisphere is Panama, where virtually everyone speaks the same language; Spanish.

In Europe, the radical right has a separate party from mainstream conservatives and they espouse things anti-immigration politics and separate but equal racial ideologies. In the US, people like that do not form a separate party because 3rd parties have no Earthly chance of winning anything in the US so they integrate into the mainstream conservative party (Republican Party).

The &quot;I&#39;d like to give the world a Coke&quot; commercial showed kids of all races holding hands and singing the song together. I believe that was around 1972. In different countries the song was sung in different languages. Perhaps these Republican mouth-breathers aren&#39;t aware that Coca-Cola is THE most widely distributed product in the world? This commercial should have surprised, offended, and disturbed exactly zero people, including the most ignorant flag-waving racists in the GOP. ¬†	UCQswxhgXNpmGUW93HoGl_UQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQswxhgXNpmGUW93HoGl_UQ	0

For those who clamor for the legalization of drugs, coke did have cocaine extract in it when it was first developed, but the law forced a change. To be fair, one could look at this from the perspective of society management and society liberty. Just be forewarned that this type of "liberty" leads to a host of social horrors.

It&#39;s not about telling people that they can&#39;t speak their mother tongue, and we shouldn&#39;t force them to, its about helping new americans get the best chance possible to be successful. It just seems irrational to say you don&#39;t have to learn english while the most successful people in the world are bilingual with English as their second language not. Most linguist believe that english will become a universal language by 2050 and possibly earlier. To knock down the notion because of one idiots reasoning does not make it a bad idea though advocating it be done by force IS wrong and I wouldn&#39;t disagree with you there.

By objecting to that guys comment that all immigrants should learn english by law they made the right decision but not for the right reason. its not wrong because he is racist, maybe he is and maybe he isn't I don't know, it is wrong to require it by law. People can think whatever they want but it is not okay to force someone to do something against their will, racist or not.

Yet they shouldn&#39;t be required to do so, cuz it&#39;s harder the older you get.<br /><br />Unusually the younger and next gen do learn English as well as their native tongue. Its a better idea to reach out to them and help them. Yet the older should also be provided services so they don&#39;t get left behind.<br /><br />As for Canada, IMHO, all Canadians should be bilingual in English, the international language, and French, another major language.

Unlike most Americans, I&#39;ve lived in a foreign country for several years. No other country in the world take in immigrants and doesn&#39;t expect them to learn the language of the land. If you want to become a fully functional member of society in Japan, you either learn the language full on or get the fuck out. That&#39;s how most countries in the world are. It&#39;s not racist, it&#39;s just reality.	UCis86si653LkCkDsiS4XcEw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCis86si653LkCkDsiS4XcEw	0

On the federal level, the United States does not have an official language. 27 states (just barely over half) have passed laws/statutes/whatever declaring English is that STATE&#39;s official language, and many states (like Louisiana and several northeastern states) also list French or Spanish equally alongside English as official state languages... but on the federal level, we do not have an official language. Probably because we are a melting pot of multiculturalism, and even when it was mostly white people immigrating here they weren&#39;t all English speakers from England. Or it could be because we&#39;re spiraling out of control into a communist hellscape where we&#39;re forced to buy Coke for illegals. Tossup really.

It's not genetic, and it didn't come from God,despite what some zealots compel their herds to believe. Racism , or classism, feminism, statism, religion, etc, are just ideas. Ideas, which are pushed like levers, thrust forward and reversed in order to divide and control. You are exposed to it at a very early age, it's programmed. And while your early exposure may be benign, those receptors remain active for your entire life and accumulate stuff. It's like a cancer virus, manufactured, spread from the top down. Once it's out of the vile it's difficult to contain and bio-accumulates. It's not self-fulfilling, because you can control it, or treat it, once you know what it is. It's not a fraud - it's real, people are dying because of it. Am I a carrier of racism - yes, we all are.

Not so sure I buy that examples of racial prejudice on TV are simply manufactured. Hell, you're of the opinion that such manufactured racism _creates_ racism, so does it not stand to reason that they'd only have to fabricate racism at the onset and then merely record the resulting chaos to feed back into the loop? So it's actually more of a self-fulfilled prophecy than a fraud currently, right? It's not those examples on TV are false, they're just the result of jewish, no doubt, intervention, yes? So not even you believe that they're simply manufactured now.	UCK_LGYQVsjvEsZq95LOhR2A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK_LGYQVsjvEsZq95LOhR2A	1	UgiCvJuIt9xFX3gCoAEC	Jack194343

They are just ideas, promoted by people in power, who use such things as mechanisms to divide and/or maintain control. Racism could end in one generation if they wanted it to - but it fits a purpose, and provides a great distraction. The racism that you see on tv isn't real, it's manufactured, it's porn - it targets the weak mind. The more you are exposed to something, the more likely you crave it. And racism is no different. Anyone who has kids understand that children do not see race, just colors, like a box of crayons. As kids get older, and exposed to "race", you find they segregate themselves. Racism is taught in Public elementary school classrooms as early as the first grade. By the 3rd grade it's institutionalized - they believe Abe Lincoln's [Imperialist] Army burned the homes, cities, crops, places of worship, of Southerners because of voter suppression (and Global Warming :) I'm not sure it's possible to end racism, because they don't want it to end. If you believe that it is deliberate, and understand the motivations behind it - it's pretty easy to live your life without seeing race.

Someone with no particular bias can disagree after exposure and of course people with inherent biases against his writings are very likely to disagree. Hell, people can read his writings and agree with any number of things he's said and disagree with a whole host of other things he's said. So why would we just assume exposure to his writings creates Marxists in of itself? We wouldn't, though we could safely assume that the odds of someone having read Marx is very high within the ranks of Marxists, that much is at least true. Then again, Marxism is a bit of a different beast compared to racism. Marxism is a political, social, and economic construct while racism is simply discrimination based upon race. Also I'm not so sure racism is necessarily deliberate. I think it's very possible for someone to be unaware of their own biases. Besides, ignoring the racism within society in a bid to stop the potential creation of racists seems sketchy at best. How would you intend to solve the problem of racism without exposure?

Therefore, if not from exposure, and racism comes from racists - it must be genetic? I know, I'm playing semantics... and most people would think that genetic racism is preposterous. But, do you really think that exposure to racism does not perpetuate or create racists? What about books, does exposure to Karl Marx produce Marxists - or does that just happen naturally? IMO, racism is a deliberate action, externally¬† imposed by those who seek to divide, control, then conquer. Racism, like Marxism, is not inherent - it is learned.

I get it that it is about unity, but why is it unity under america? I don&#39;t get what they are going for. if they stuck with just1st and second generation immigrants singing in their native tongue that would be awesome!, but then it shows shots from cities clearing outside of the US so then the choice of song ceases to make sense...<br /><br />I don&#39;t care about eh racial angle to this, its just that the message seems very paradoxical...

The US was built on the backs of immigrants, it was stolen and conquered by immigrants, and has always had an influx of immigration. This isn't about stamping out anyone, it's about welcoming people from all over the world because that is what America is about: a nation built by immigrants for immigrants.

I work with the public and I hate dealing with people who can&#39;t speak english at all or only speak in broken english. Their kids usually speak better english than them and usually have to do the talking.	UCFA6ZVqHi9rZdncI4K6GDAw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFA6ZVqHi9rZdncI4K6GDAw	0

I don't think you could more perfectly demonstrate how to imply you are something, while trying to deny it. Oh geez, I actually laughed out loud at that. I do sincerely hope that was intentional, or I am sorry and genuinely do recommend you read up on how to speak and write, as what you said is literally a textbook examples of dodging the question (specifically by changing the topic). And already anticipating the 'I was just bringing it back *on* topic', you already responded to such a statement, committing yourself to such a discussion, and discussing it as though it were the topic. Sorry, but in a open forum, you're too likely to get called out on such things. Step your game up. Oh, and before the obvious response comes, your employment status was being discussed, therefore it was 'in question', therefore it is perfectly accurate to refer to it as 'dodging the question'. +Thomas MacKelly¬† (To be read in the voice of an old-timey newspaper editor): As for you, copy-and-paste for a direct quote man. That, and start your sentences with capital letters. He could have easily gotten away with calling out the mistake in your quote, and you're just lucky he took the wrong road, right into the path of two-timing politico doublespeak. lol.

Now, keep it in mind when reading this, because I'm talking about the point that quote makes. We call people from Asia, Asian, right? And people from Europe, European, right? People from Africa are African, people from the Americas are...? That's right, etymologically, the *correct* term would be American, except that that term has been taken to refer to something else. That's the premise of the quote. Remember the quote we're talking about? If not, go back to the start and reread it. Now that we see the discrepancy between what is etymologically correct, and what is commonly used, we start to see the *point* of the quote. The point is *not* to call attention to the misuse. If you thought it was, you're really not paying any attention. No one is trying to say, 'US citizen shouldn't be calling themselves American, 'cause it dilutes the usage of the word' (Okay, maybe some crazy person somewhere is, but that's not my point, and not the point of the quote. Did you forgot the quote? Go back and reread it.) What that quote *is* calling attention to is the concept that there is such a divergence between how things actually are, and how they are perceived, that the largest groups get a disproportionately *larger* amount of recognition. The majority of people in the Americas live *outside* the United States. If you pay attention though, you'd see that, from almost any source, the US is given a majority of any attention paid to the Americas, despite not having a majority of the population, even from sources that are outside the Americas altogether. It's the point that the troll that you defended illustrated so well in his first post. It's the egotistical assumption that everyone must always be thinking about and talking about them, and that they are the only people that matter. The point is that the majority of Americans, and yea, that Americans as in the United States of America, because that's the common parlance, would do well to think of people other than themselves sometimes. Do you get the point of the quote now?	UC13ko8XUbU5PpEbmVwQa6yA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC13ko8XUbU5PpEbmVwQa6yA	1	UgjsrzhE6UxGm3gCoAEC	maxcoseti

Most people don't call themselves American if they weren't born in the USA because most people refer to themselves by their country of birth just like someone born in SA wouldn't call himself South American, but Brazilian(for example) when asked "what are you?" It's the same reason Asians don't all call themselves Asians when talking to other people born on the same continent, it's too broad of a description. Of course they *could* call themselves American or Asian, but in a conversation that's too general to mean anything. People think you're talking about the USA when you say American because America is part of the countries name, not because it's in North America.

UgjsrzhE6UxGm3gCoAEC.7-H0Z7-PBIO7-HHbCuDrrS		0	2014-02-04 09:00:06	reaperoa	+Hans Blitz Ah, I'm in a funny mood, so I'll humor you. Now, read this paragraph and the next, carefully, because if your response indicates that you didn't, I'm just going to mute you. *That's* for the argumentum ad hominem. The stupidity I find entertaining. That's a game I'm willing to play because the myriad different routes such willful ignorance takes makes the whole thing entertaining. The logical fallacy, however, is too boring and predictable so, likewise, another logical fallacy will see me mute you. Consider it a personal challenge for you to grow as a troll, and a courtesy to someone that uses proper punctuation and grammar. First, reread the original post (not mine, the very first one). That would be the one with the movie quote. Now, look up 'the America*s*'. That's *North, Central and South* America. Okay, that done? Yes. Canada is located within North America, which is one of the Americas. Ignorant people, (like you) that barely have a grasp of the English language, use the word 'America' to refer to the United States, but that does not diminish the fact that, if you speak English properly (the majority of people don't, including those that know the etymology of the word), anyone that is tied to any of the counties in the Americas is 'American'. The whole point of that quote is to call attention to the stupidity of such a common misuse of the English language, and anyone that has even a passing knowledge of geography knows why it's stupid to refer those from the United States as 'American'. As for the whole airport security thing you mentioned earlier, if you're a citizen of a county in the Americas other than the United States, of course it would be stupid to say you're 'an American', as a lot of the people working airport security are, like you, ignorant, with barely enough understanding of the English language to make it through a day to day conversation. You'd be etymologically correct, when you said it, but the whole irony would pass clean over too many people's heads, just like yours. Oh, and it would be "'American'?". The quotation mark goes inside the question mark because it's not a full sentence, and it's a single quotation mark, because it's not a direct quote. You can also use asterisks to bold for emphasis now, although in this case I think that would make the sentence lose some of its tone.

(And even if you don't know the specific words, you recall the message of the song, right?) Then, when listening to it, pay attention to the inflection and tone of those singing in different languages. Not so different from someone singing in English, right? It's a beautiful song, and is just as beautiful in different languages. All these different people come together and make something more than the sum of them.

TYT claims liberalism/progressiveness is on the rise in America. However, the vast majority, over 80%, of Americans support making English our official language; thus, the condemnation/criticism of this ad likely crosses ideological and party lines. Libs and conservatives can agree, this is an English-speaking country and English should be learned and spoken by people who move, and are born, here.

I'll leave that argument aside for now. One thing that is indisputable is that the English language is a living language. It is ever-changing and evolving, like all languages. Which English is it people want to make official? The English of the present? Which English will be official in a thousand years when the English spoken may be a different from that of today's United States, as contemporary English is from the Old English of Beowulf or the Middle English of Chaucer. There is, and can't be, any precise, enduring and incontestable definition of what exactly is and is not English. I have a Jamaican acquaintance whose English is 75% incomprehensible to me. I've seen A Scottish movie that came with English subtitles, even though they were speaking English in the movie. If Jamaica institutes phonetic spelling reforms, will that spelling be acceptable in the US? What about if individual US states decided to do the same thing? If one state keeps the spelling as caramel and another opts for carml, based on how their residents actually pronounce it, is one of them no longer in English? And will courts be prohibited from using all that Latin legal language? Should we no longer celebrate Cajun heritage? Or should we keep celebrating it, as long as those remaining few Cajun French speakers do not allow any children to grow up with it as their primary language? After all those bastards have had two damn centuries to learn the fucking language. Should we keep letting the Amish have their own schools (freedom of religion and all that jazz), but insist that the language of instruction is English. And finally, should those southwestern Spanish speaking communities that have existed longer than the United States be required to give up their language? Not because they came to our country, but because we came to their country. 	UCURJhA5JKvZDy5dRdlqC6iQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCURJhA5JKvZDy5dRdlqC6iQ	1	UghXzufr8J7jz3gCoAEC	ChristianMission

For many, many people culture and identity come from they're language. The goal of this ad (aside from selling Coke) was to promote multi-culturalism. As language and culture often go hand in hand it makes sense to continue that point by singing the song in other languages. At the same time the ad doesn't ever promote not learning English. You seem to be discounting the idea of actively speaking multiple languages. If you were to move to a different country with a different language then you would probably learn that language. At the same time however I'm sure you would not abandon English. Basically, understand the difference between language as a tool to enable communication and language as a means of cultural expression.

If you&#39;re not a native american, then you came from illegal immigrants to start with. The country was founded on immigrants that took over the continent without the consent of the natives. So please! So many countries respect having many languages spoken in their country and even sing their anthem in multiple languages. It should NOT be a problem if an ad does it.

Canada is multi-cultural and I can attest to the fact it is extremely frustrating sometimes. I go to school where everyone is asian and speaks a different language.

She once told me that when she goes to Hong-Kong for a visit, she has to hide the pictures she has with me because her grandmother would not like to see her with a non-Chinese. She says she does not trust non-Chinese people.

MANY people know spanish and english.

Spanish was indeed developed in Spain, before the conquistadors enslaved the native population in Americas and taught them to speak Spanish. So, yes, languages have history tied to races. Languages are a part of the cultural identity of people. However, they change just as the culture does when people assimilate. English has not existed forever. It developed from other languages before it and will continue to change into languages to come in the future. Development and propagation of languages is a temporal and spatial phenomena based on how humans move and interact. But everything said and done, even if I take you at face value and were to concede that it is only about just the English language, why should anyone become so rigid and possessive about a phenomena as elusive and ever-changing as a language? Why demand everyone to be the same, to speak the same?	UCGUkrCgZHGdUHm-Bsqwo01A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGUkrCgZHGdUHm-Bsqwo01A	1	UgjRTepMJkGX23gCoAEC	Vyppaaa11

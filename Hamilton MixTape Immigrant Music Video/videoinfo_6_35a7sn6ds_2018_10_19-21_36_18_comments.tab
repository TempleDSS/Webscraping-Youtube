Logic is power not feelings.<br /><br />now to clear up some misunderstanding, most of these people in this music video work in Mexico, which means u are no immigrant, u are an Mexican that exports to US for a living.<br />that where the difference comes in.<br /><br />if it were up to me and a mother to 7 hungry children crossed the border illegally, i&#39;d send them back without and form of mercy since criminals have no place in the US, and remember that the distinction is that if you cross without permission and papers and the proper vetting by taking anohter route in, whereas the authorities don&#39;t know. that automatically makes you a criminal. since you broke the law. Period. <br /><br />Just ask yourself this Question<br /><br />You are on the way to Saudi Arabia you have no veil, and if you&#39;re homosexual, you&#39;ll get killed, if you are a blasphemer you will get killed, if you are a woman you will get raped if u have no veil on and a husband.<br /><br /><br />now just think about it.<br /><br />if u immigrated to Mexico you would get no help at all. why should we help them?<br /><br /><br />But overall, it&#39;s a great song. it just needs to reflect the reality a little more.

People go into America to get a job, education, and help. They come to America to get a better life, and in a lot of cases, work harder then the people who live their. America is a land founded by immagrants, almost everyone in America is an immagrant.	UCe_FuhwR9SaJSPhSBSv2ayw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe_FuhwR9SaJSPhSBSv2ayw	0

Four generations ago, a pair of brothers came from Greece on an illegal banana boat (them banana smugglers, shame shame) to America. They got in a huge argument and decided to part ways, then changed their last names from something very beautifully and proudly Greek to two different American sounding surnames. They bypassed the Island and went straight to work in America. They eventually became citizens when they had the money for it and I&#39;m proud to be their great-great-great-great whatever. They were illegal immigrants. They did what they had to do for a better life. I respect that.<br /><br />People forget that immigrants (illegal or not) are people, too. We should reach out a hand and make becoming a citizen a little easier (don&#39;t even hit me with that &quot;but then the crazy ISIS folk will get us&quot; because they&#39;re already here, fam. Terrorists have been in America since day one). I know not every immigrant is the honest type who&#39;s just trying to make a living and raise a family, but why should they suffer because of a few bad seeds? They&#39;re not bad people. They&#39;re our people.	UCysfXrbnAOXykLnLYBzEugA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCysfXrbnAOXykLnLYBzEugA	0

Everyone in this country is an immigrant that lives on stolen land. One of my greatest frears is that my grandmother, my tias, tios and primos will be forced back to Mexico because of white extremists. Yes every single one of them were born in the U.S. but I&#39;m afraid that they would be forced out because the color of their skin and the practice of their mother&#39;s tongue. I don&#39;t wish this on anyone one. It doesn&#39;t matter if you were or weren&#39;t born in this stupid racist country that supposed to be the epiphany of &quot;freedom.&quot; As far as I am concerned EVERYONE has the right to come to this country to make create their one happiness. And this issue that immigrants are taking our jobs. Usually it&#39;s the job no one whats to do, and the majority of my generation are lazy sh**s that don&#39;t want to work.

If you willingly allow your culture and history to be forgotten without fighting/protesting back, then that is just spineless.

Americans came to escape taxes (even though Britain was paying more) and they murdered millions who lived there first and capture and enslave other people then turn around and tell the same people to &quot;go back to their country&quot; and don&#39;t let people who are trying to escape certain death into &#39;their&#39; land. I&#39;m glad I&#39;m not American, sorry good Americans.	UCioSDiItrv5CWejzWOdZP3w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCioSDiItrv5CWejzWOdZP3w	0

Of course there were peaceful natives, but were killed off by rival tribes and European diseases. The Trail of Tears was a brutal and dark time in history for the Cherokee, and Andrew Jackson is guilty for executing the order. I also didn't say that you were blaming Europe. Of course enslavement was wrong, all of the countries of the Americas (North America, Central America, and South America) should be at blame for practicing it.

The near by tribes didn't murder everyone because they just wanted to there was many accounts of natives sparing lives and raising abandoned white children. Also if you look at it historically Andrew Jackson indirectly murdered thousands on the trail of tears. Furthering I'm not blaming Europe for slaves im blaming America for enslaving and owning people which is morally incorrect in every way you look at it.

The United Kingdom started to start unnecessary wars with other nations and began to expand to quickly for its own good. The colonist decided to escape the rule and revolt against the kingdom. The colonists were sent to... guess what? Colonize. The colonist conquered and drove out the natives who were threatening them. Due to the lack of knowledge of the spread of diseases, the colonists had involuntarily killed off the natives they decided to coexist with. Now enslavement of people of African tribes was entirely wrong. Don't blame white Europeans for starting the enslavement. There were many tribes and empires within Africa, many of whom fought with one another, and for those who had lost paid the price of being enslaved by their victor. Europeans arrive on African land and are offered to purchase these conquered and enslaved tribes.

The only immigration I truly like is original European Immigration, because they have actually got the jobs done. If you want to look at immigration as if this song was true, look at California, the entire middle class is leaving California because of their stupidity. Just to let you know, our people of the constitution came legally -- not illegally. Thank you my dear young girl. If you want to see immigration at it's finest, look at the rape & murder rate that boomed in Sweden and Germany shortly after the mass immigration. Or if you want to see immigration? Look at I-80 in America with sex trafficking from Mexican Drug Cartels. Immigration is not too great because you would be risking your true citizens, and their culture for people who left their nations, and instead of fixing it. Talk to Merkel, and then ask Germans their opinions of her.	UCJu_z-2bWitUZd6CUL-uGiA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJu_z-2bWitUZd6CUL-uGiA	1	UgyZHWaGq9m1G0u4jHR4AaABAg	Duygu Ecem Ertan

Where the fuck is our representation? Also, where are the other Asian American rappers? Come on man. The only acceptable excuse is if there was some shit going on that they were purposefully ignored, but knowing this culture, they didnt want any trouble to their money machine, so they must have not even bothered.

I&#39;m first Generation to be born in America along with my two other sisters. I&#39;m 11 (Turing 12 on June 7th) years old and I lost my mom, yet she has no criminal record since she doesn&#39;t drive a car &amp; etc. My mom works her ass off for My sisters and I and now since she&#39;s gone we have to do things that 11 year old shouldn&#39;t do, like actually be an adult and help your family finically while still in school. <br /><br />My Father is now in this issue too, and if I losses the case we go back. If I were born in my country I wouldn&#39;t have be even alive today, to be true I think as myself to be a miracle that they went to America before I was born. To end this, My family and I have been here for almost 20 years and it&#39;s ashamed that to see a land that is supposed to be united and stand together and now to see it Divided and separated by Race.

I have work for many of them to free them and give them some recognition and dignity in this type of world... I spend so much time in my life to help these peoples, and those one on the street who has nowhere to live.<br /><br />The truth is, I don&#39;t support all of them, I see them destroy so many place who as really take care of them, sometimes the entire island, the entire city, freak peoples out, beeing irrationnally agressive, claim that&#39;s because of what they lived, what they saw, what means persons has done to them, their in the right way and the right duty to bit innocent and some racist people, sell hard drugs to naive person (some of them have abused the trust of fragile peoples..I saw it), destroyed market place, stole things of innocent peoples,and destroyed what theses peoples have build for themself, the city, their place. I think it&#39;s that type of immigrants peoples talk about. In some city they are in very much majority, and they cause so much pain and anger, so racism and anti-immigrant movement. That type of strangers too...that time of homeless people who throw away a sandwich a poor people who don&#39;t even have the money to feed himself properly give to him. Believer and hypocrite, militants and activists sometimes lies, and people ARE TIRED to listen to them. Discridibility, that&#39;s all they gets, and also the cause and peoples they defend.<br /><br /> I was totally helpless, disapointed for what my organism and I, have done, thoses country and city we worked for, we worked on, became a victim of what we do, and what these means &quot;things&quot; do. So I quit, and work in another job. When an helpless person came to me fortunatly, I help her to build her new life in my country, but that was very occasionnally.<br /><br /> Then I came in Brittany, I came in so much others places. I saw very much immigrants, so sweet, so smart, and heartwarming, who have sometimes, have live so much worst things than the others who claim they have the right to be evil. These people make me smile, again. Because these peoples make me proud of my ancient work, proud of them, proud of what I&#39;ve done, what I say, what I fight for, proud of what my country and people like me have given to them. I though, so I will help these people again, and give them the right choice. So I start to work again, more than 15 years later for this type of immigrants, strangers, homeless, victimes of violence, who came from helly hell, who choose to totally quit violence and negative things to start a true new life and respect the peoples who take care of them, and the city who give them mercy and freedom they ask for. <br /><br />Even if there are only one immigrant/millions who deserve it, save him and give him the life and the love he deserve. I came from slavery, I was sexually abused, mentally raped, brutalized, destroyed in all the way I can, in all the way you can imagine...I never do anything bad to others. Because I never wish for it, what I live isn&#39;t the others fault. They don&#39;t deserve to be the victims of my anger and my pain. So don&#39;t think you&#39;re right if you don&#39;t think like that, you&#39;re wrong, and you&#39;re immature, and what you done is worst than what your abusers has done to you.<br /><br /> <b>KEEP IT IN YOUR MIND!</b> <br /><br /><br />So yeah, immigrants, <b>we get the job done.</b>	UCqANRBOKh4s6sgUr7R09cqw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqANRBOKh4s6sgUr7R09cqw	0

America belonged to Native Indians, just because they &quot;gave it up&quot; doesn&#39;t mean our family hostory wasn&#39;t immigrants. I&#39;m only 10-15% Native Indian and I still do think that I have immigrants in my family, both of my mom and dads side. James my dad is 100% African American (I was told), and My moms side is mixed with a whole lot of immigrants (European, South East Asia, etc) I am American, but back then my family wasn&#39;t except my great great great great grandfather (or grandma, I was told my that one of them was white, and the other Indian) <br /><br />In reality we are all immigrants expect Native Indians.

And I hate it how people from &quot;America&quot; say that immigrant are bad and shit, but that&#39;s not what they thought when Christopher Columbus got here. That not what they thought they drove Natives off their own land! Americans feel threaten by immagrants?! How do you they think Natives felt when they came along?! When they stole their traditions and their land! Maybe immagrants are &quot;evil&quot; , because they&#39;re looking for a better life. And once immagrants get the job and they don&#39;t, they get pissed and start throwing hate. It&#39;s not the damn immagrants fault that immagrants here to work and get a better life, and th they&#39;re here because their Mommy told them to get their lazy ass up and work! Immagrants are bad?! Then all of America is bad!!! White, Balck, Brown, Yellow, Green, Purple , whatever damn color you are!, your an immagrant! Get over yourselves !

It&#39;s a dangerous freight train where drug lord make them pay a fee to let them go past the resting points. And then the one part with Ris MC, where the train is more like an European/NY subway and cuts to images of Middle East and the refugee camps, makes allusion to the actual border fence on Turkey and Greece and actual living conditions of some refugee <br /> camps :/	UC7_3juNTTZdv0ysF35y9kkQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7_3juNTTZdv0ysF35y9kkQ	0		
Ugx3Kj9fMWqwQ0VRrph4AaABAg	1	18	2018-05-10 04:02:24	SpartanWolfGaming	America is the self proclaimed melting pot. She is so special because EVERYONE who lives here came from somewhere else. Even Native Americans came across on the Bering Straight land-bridge during the last Ice Age. We are the product of humanity coming together despite differences and working so that everyone has equal opportunity to build a life with their own two hands.<br />That is my America. Unfortunately, Nationalism has turned to Nativism for so many of my countrymen. Those who came from other places are scorned for &quot;stealing&quot; our jobs, despite the concept that we are all from elsewhere at some point in our genetic history.<br />What we need to do as a nation, is come together under Old Glory, and fight to make this a place where we build an overarching, unique culture from ALL the contributions of others and their heritage. We need to see our Immigrants as future Americans or as allies, not as enemies to be feared.<br />That is how America can fix herself. That is how we will be what we set out to be. A land where all men (nowadays referring to Mankind, not just male humans) are seen as being created equal. Where they are all entitled to the right to seek their own way, and their own life. Liberty is a song written long ago, but it hasn&#39;t been shut off. We just need to crank the volume up again.<br />Signed,<br />-A Second Generation American.

He had 6000 dollars saved up by 7 months of just being there. I was shocked and said &quot;how did you do that you just got here&quot; lol. I started working overtime and I partly learned because of him. Today I have 14,000 saved. He showed me how to take every oppurtunity for overtime.

Those are just some words that not all immigrants are deserved to be called! As a child of immigrants, I know that my WHOLE family suffered to get here! Passing throught a desert or river just to have a better life is nothing bad! If it werent for immigrants, America would not be the same! It would be so much worse! So these racist people have to get their mind straight or not then just leave America! Without immigrants there is no &quot; Great America&quot;! Immigrants are all around you! No matter where you go, there is an immigrant! I am just trying to defend my race because it is just very upsetting seeing people talking crap about us! How bow you go talk to your ancestors like that............ oh never mind don&#39;t do that because your ancestors are immigrants!!! So just remember if you aren&#39;t an immigrant, your ancestors can be! So never think that just because you are a white american doesn&#39;t mean you are a perfect person or a person that deserves better than immigrants! Immigrants get the job done for you!

White people treat us like shit as if we were slaves that they can use and then throw us away. It&#39;s was us Immigrants who&#39;ve found America and built it to wear it stands now. Back in the day were Martin Luther King made the I Have A Dream Speech? He wasn&#39;t just aiming it at African American people, he was aiming it at all of us! I have a dream that Trump will not be elected the next president for second term. <br /><br />I&#39;m a Latina at 11 years old I&#39;m going to lose my mom to deportation and she going to leave my life for 10 God damn years and by then she&#39;ll miss out on my Graduation for high school, birthdays and what if I get married or get a boyfriend and he wants to meet my mother? He can&#39;t do that because she gone from my life for 10 years and by then I&#39;ll be 21. <br /><br />All of you supporters for trump may say &quot;Why can&#39;t you just go with your mother?&quot; Well that because I have Asthma, Gerd and 7 other disease and it would be bad for me to go to Honduras were I could potentially die from the airplane ride or the lack of medication there. Know For all of the supporters for trump I&#39;m going to give you a little view of how I see things, Imagine one of your family members like a Mother, Father, Sister or brother getting deported for 10 years because someone says so and that person that they deport did nothing wrong in their entire life! They just wanted to flee their country because of the homoscide there.<br /><br />It&#39;s also kind of strange that Trump lives with an immigrant and he deports other immigrants. What if I was President and deported Trump&#39;s wife? How would her kid feel and how would it affect them Emotionally and physically? And not to mention how would it affect Trump? Well he move one and find another girl to take her place, so.<br /><br />Today- Friday at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_35a7sn6ds&amp;t=3m30s">3:30</a>am I&#39;m losing my mom and I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll ever see her again. She could get killed, I could not be able too ride the plan to Honduras and my sisters would be able too and not me. How would it affect me that I&#39;m the third person that can&#39;t see my mum because of my Asthma?<br /><br />I&#39;m going to end my rant and say this to the Gringos, &quot;Think about what you&#39;ve done? And how it would affect the Children and everyone else around them.&quot;	UCFUcKMSpJAM0bYnIXVlmBow	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFUcKMSpJAM0bYnIXVlmBow	0

My entire family moved to America from Braga, Portugal when I was 4 and now we have a thriving bakery in the small town we live in and our bakery becomes flooded with customers during the summer since a lot of people come to Cape Cod for the beaches during the summer. Oh, there‚Äôs also a Portuguese American Club not too far from where I live where my grandmother is the head chef in the kitchen. But the best part is probably the fact that in school I can swear in Portuguese and nobody understands because there are only 3 other people that are fluent in Portuguese in my school and I‚Äôve already become best friends with them.

I believe in 1 race: humans. Who are we to decide where someone lives? People have created borders on earth but we don&#39;t get to choose on which side of the immaginary line we are born. I also don&#39;t think we have the right to tell someone they can now not cross that created line. If we all learned to share instead of being selfish........

More people need to understand that just because your life is falling apart, you can&#39;t blame it on &quot;immigrants&quot;. That is the dumbest reason I&#39;ve ever heard. These people that you call &quot;immigrants&quot; are people to. Obviously, Alexander Hamilton was an immigrant. He brought this country from bankruptcy to prosperity. Appreciate everything here, and if you don&#39;t like me and my fellow &quot;immigrants&quot;, then get the fuck out because we didn&#39;t ask for you opinion. People take the time out of their day to blame everything wrong on &quot;immigrants&quot;. ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME!?!? Instead of doing that, you could be fixing what&#39;s wrong. Now, if you don&#39;t stop being a fucking asshole, I will gather an army and take you down, thank you very much.

So yeah he was an illegal immigrant who was granted citizenship in the newly independent US after proving he would contribute to the country. I don't see why we don't have a similar policy; if someone has been here for years working hard with no indication that they plan to do anything but strive for success in a country that's all about ambition, why wouldn't we let them stay? Because they couldn't afford the process that's only purpose is to prove what they've already been displaying for so long?

I mean the USA is basically made out of different people (Hispanics,Asians, African Americans, European, and more) we are all different in our own ways. But the white Americans do the easy work and the other race of people do the hard tough work because no one else wants to do it. They say we are stealing their jobs when in reality they‚Äôre the ones who basically offered it to them because no one that is American (white) wants to do it. That‚Äôs how I see it. no hate I think the people who are immigrants and pay taxes and all that other stuff are Americans. üôÉno hate we all have our opinions üòù	UC8JoiTTgimUt44GWj1zJDKw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8JoiTTgimUt44GWj1zJDKw	0

There's a reason all countries have boarders and there's a reason all countries have such a thing as birthright. There's a difference between not taking useless people and kicking out useless people. If citizenship can be revoked at the snap of a finger once you become useless to the economy, useful people won't immigrate and the system doesn't work, cuz why would you want to live in a country without out a guarantee that you can stay once you successfully immigrated or that doesn't guarantee your children can stay, even if they're a burden? So we at least need birthright and legal immigration that can't be revoked at the drop of a hat. Does the country need illegals? Clearly not, it's doing fine the way it is evidently. Is it morally obligated to take them in? Debateable and subjective. Could it benefit from it? Well, yes. But it could benefit more from taking the best and leaving the worst, which you don't get with random, uncontrolled immigration. Only by allowing certain people in. "So basically, the children who can't speak english now but could go on to figure out how to travel in space by light years are not worth the trouble because they came here illegally" Yes. There's no guarantee that one of them will do that. If they show themselves to be capable of that you can bet your ass they'll get citizenship *and* a scholarship. Simply put. There's a reason basically every successful country works like that. Maybe try to think that problem through from a none moral perspective.

And I know it's boring to learn a new lenguage, but maybe you could think in every other person that doesen't lives in a native English speaking contry, and it's basically forced to learn English, beacause if we don't do it, we mean nothing for the world. Every lenguage is beautiful en it's own way, and learning one that isn't your native one, helps you to understand another realities, at least that is what I think. Saludos.

Only then did I ask about my heritage and how my family came to be in this land. <br /><br />I&#39;ve had my eyes opened to the fact that those who come here at a young age work the hardest in what they do. Unlike some of us who were born into this country and not taking advantage of what it has to offer. <br /><br />Get to know where you come from. Learn from the history of those stories. Honor that history by giving 200% in everything you do and being living proof that immigrants, we get the job ‚úÖ	UCd_56tiOw3E7ho1BrNgMMzw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCd_56tiOw3E7ho1BrNgMMzw	0

Makes it tougher to get into colleges. Drives up tuition costs. Costs more to pay for more teachers and police. Immigration is a mixed bag. Good for business. Bad for labor. Good for teacher. Bad for students, Good for landlords. Bad for renters. All this DREAMer stuff on the media but nothing about gang bangers in prison. Immigrants are in general nice people but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s a free lunch for the country they settle in.

Their origin immigrated here. They just continued the progress that the Natives made. Like immigrants today. Immigrants today continued the whites&#39; progress that the whites&#39; continued from the Natives. Immigrants today never claimed America theirs. They just wanted to get a better life, not to claim land or take control of take away power. Immigrants what to give and get back.

Immigration worked before the government gave lazy Sudanese criminals $400 pw in tax payer money so they can spend all day breaking into people&#39;s houses and bashing the locals like they do here in Melbourne. Back in the old days, the Vietnamese immigrated in the 70&#39;s and were forced to WORK and GET EDUCATED or get sent back to Communist Vietnam. Now the Vietnamese are rich and own a lot of million dollar real estate.	UCpu9KIwlP7bN9fymW6ig7_w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpu9KIwlP7bN9fymW6ig7_w	0

Secure border is NOT against immigrants. Congress is a bunch of misrepresenting liars. There is NO legal immigration available per Congress...(unless you are relative of citizen or refugee). It&#39;s bullshit....People need to DEMAND Congress to rewrite the immigration protocol, cause it is worthless right now!

I am legally born in the US while I do come from a Hispanic bloodline. Many a times I have had white people judge me. A nurse acted extremely rude to us while she treated the american citizens well. It hurts,honestly.By saying that Hispanics or African American don't get judged is a big understatment. We get extremely judged, even in proffesional areas.

First off, if you're immigrating from mexico it has a base of 5 years of wait, if you don't have family its 10 years, if you don't have ""redeeming"" qualities its 15 years old and if you lack education its 20-25 years at best. At any moment the U.S. can deny you the visa, for any reason, say you get hurt/injured. Through the immigration prosseces you have to pay 2k for papers you need to fill out, in english, and if they are not completed in time they deny you a visa. They don't refund 2k. 2k in Mexico is almost 25k pesos, something most mexicans don't have and cannot work to pay for it since most jobs only pay say 100 pesos a day, and most items cost 50-100 pesos. A coke costs 15 pesos. A milk jug is 25. Meat is 60.	UCzbWFlLU5MTTyuMmKsWnjXw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzbWFlLU5MTTyuMmKsWnjXw	1	Ugzp6mB-TxgjdJk2Wnp4AaABAg	ASD FGG

NONE of the reasons for you not being hired is because of your nationality or skin color. And sorry if the process is too long to get your visa, but it‚Äôs designed so we don‚Äôt have half the world trying to populate our country. If you come here legally, then great. If you come here illegally, then you need to bounce the fuck on outta here.	UC6QnAEFIQjo5fPLAV3_P3RA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6QnAEFIQjo5fPLAV3_P3RA	1	Ugzp6mB-TxgjdJk2Wnp4AaABAg	ASD FGG

Once they do get that visa, their work opportunities are extremely limited. Once someone does get a visa, their visas are usually designed to give them seasonal or one time jobs. Not to mention, unless the immigrate has family or an employer already in America, they will most likely only get a temporary visa. Permanent visas can take up to 20 years to obtain. So basically, a lot more people would come over legally but we still treat them like shit no matter what.

We all wistfully think that every body could understand Lin‚Äôs geniusly tailored music that truly show how America was built on the hands of the damned but we all know there will be people who can never truly understand the music. Do not try to argue against them, yes, stand for what it right but do not attack them but pity them. For they can never truly experience true peace for true peace comes when you yourself bring true peace to others.<br /><br />For generations upon generations, our society is built upon the guilt, sin and death that we have all committed. Nobody is in the right nor the wrong. Yes, in the past black people have been discriminated and in fact are still being discriminated, however, white people are also being called racist for merely making a harmless joke at a black person that wasn‚Äôt even tailored towards their race.<br /><br />Life isn‚Äôt fair however it is our duty as human beings to try to make it as fair as possible. To help others, to support others and to comfort others. You cannot definitively call yourself good. We can never be truly ‚Äògood‚Äô. No one is perfect. No matter what we will be judged for every single mistake we make. Every single mistake is painted in history like a black marker in the midst of blinding white. <br /><br />This song shows how America was created thanks to the now discriminated group however what are immigrants. Are they people who have sailed the seas? Escaped the claws of death an travelled away? Yes, Immigrants have and always have helped create American but does that mean all work the other people make is immediately considered pointless? So I guess the lesson is to not judge people despite even if they are European, African, Native American and every race in existence.

"dont think i didnt see those tombstones disguised as waves" is a reference to the trans atlantic slave trade. black people were routinely thrown overboard when slavers were bringing them from africa to the americas. their final resting place is at the bottom of the ocean. tombstones disguised as waves. so black immigrants coming to the americas have to cross over a graveyard of their captured, tortured, and discarded people to get here. you can relate to that however you want, but that is the actual (and obvious) meaning of that lyric.

So they are buried in the desert by other immigrants as to not leave the body out for animals. They mark them with a homemade cross as a tombstone. Since he is black however, he‚Äôs referencing the way his ancestors were brought as slaves through boats. Which would make sense in the lyrical sense, but not in truth since slavery has already ended. It‚Äôs a pretty shitty line for 2018.

As for the matter of slavery, the fact that it ever existed at all is the primary reason why African Americans have less privilege than whites. Until that fact is rectified, and African Americans enjoy a similar level of privilege and discrimination and stereotypes are but a memory, the shadow of slavery still exists.

I'm just saying that the blood of our ancestors has already dried on their hands. Me? I don't have a trace of DNA of the murdered innocent on my hands. Listen, I'm tired of people kicking and screaming about me being a wolf because of my ancestors. It's just as racist. If you mean to judge me for something my ancestors supposedly done then you're absolutely horrid. No one should ever even be compensated either for slavery, because in the U.S it's illegal, and everyone who went through it has died. So no one felt that pain. *However.* Though I said that, I am avidly against Trump. Though I hate those who kick and scream over trivial things, this doesn't dispel the constant pain and suffering that immigrants often go through. Even so much as risking their lives to get to the other side. I was rooting for them this whole video, and I realized we're finally taking a stand against it. Though the pain is still prevalent, people are finally talking. Estoy muy contenta.

If so according to the Merriam Webster dictionary, a country is "the land of a person's birth, residence, or citizenship". The native American caucus states, "the founding fathers saw tribal government as something to be admired and emulated.¬† Did you know that the U.S. Constitution is modeled after the oldest constitution in North America -- the constitution of the Seven Iroquois Nations?" (The Great Law of Peace) After all, 50 million people resided in the U.S. before it was "discovered". Each tribe with their own form of goverment that consisted of councils, head cheif, etc. Another defination states," a political state or nation or it's territory". When you say the natives had no form of government that is simple not true. I wish you the best in life and have a pleasant day. P.S. If your a descendent of a Colonist don't be ashamed of your immigrant ancestors after all they help build this country too.

I was born here and being an American is embracing my ancestry ...to be an American is to be an immigrant to many. What exactly does an American look like?...we come in different hues and with different religious or spiritual beliefs...we speak different languages...we eat different foods....we appreciate a variety of music and arts...and we bring many more valuable funds of knowledge that are as American to some as apple pie is to others. We are the new America and do not live within the confines of "becoming as American as any that were naturally born here."

Before they were naturalized through state-sponsored programs, my parents were illegal immigrants. The government tracks your immigration easily. All they have to do is look up your name and they have naturalization information. With this information, and the guaranteed jail time and deportation for lying about your immigration status, you cannot and will never get government-provided welfare. You also are still required to pay tax money because, as I‚Äôve said, your government already knows who is and isn‚Äôt illegal if they have ever once used a governmental institution like a debit card. The government wants its tax money. Did you know, the mass majority of welfare users are white American citizens? Did you also know that you invented that number straight out of your ass? Not only are your assumptions false, but you present a BS number based on them.

This song was created cause of the lyric &quot;immigrants, we get the job done.&quot; Don&#39;t fight. Enjoy the song explaining how they&#39;re saying their human too and they wants rights too, immigration is a problem and most can&#39;t afford to be legal, so stop fighting about something so little in this song.

This is perhaps such a twisted take on the Immigrants (we get the job done) verse. Both Hamilton himself and Lafayette are both immigrants absolutely, but you also want to know a cold hard fact? They weren&#39;t in any sense &quot;illegal&quot; nor were they criminals <b>in a modern sense, back then absolutely under technicalities sake for Treason against the British Empire but besides the point.</b> This is a shame the way America has gone, they&#39;ve taken every sense of the original constitution and dreams of the original founding fathers and corrupted it harder than a paid off police officer. I am a Immigrant. So is my family and our extended family, We escaped from Nazi Germany and Soviet Regime in Poland. Illegal immigrants versus legal immigrants is a HUGE difference. My father was an illegal whereas my mother and her family was legal, however my father worked hard and strived to learn the language and culture of Canada to prove he is not a criminal or someone who simply wants to leave a place where he had ties. The &quot;wall&quot; is just a bunch of bullshit but the ideal behind it makes sense. If a white man shoots up a black cop, its a disaster and racist. If a black or hispanic man shoots up a white cop, it&#39;s justified and self defence. Statistics prove that unfortunately black and hispanic men are the highest percentage of crime in both the US and Canada, of which they are criminally charged with evidence beyond all resonable doubt. Immigration is a good thing, its a VERY good thing. However, you don&#39;t allow a serial killer or a drug lord or a cartel member to move into your neighbourhood without worries, why would you let them into your country? Bias must be eliminated for a fair and justified view of the situation. This song is nothing but bias and falsehoods. Trump is nothing but extreme views and bias. Neither side is good but Hamilton&#39;s famous song quote we get the job done shouldn&#39;t and I refuse it to become nothing but ammunition for bullshit statements. Statements, because opinions allow debate and talk. This is not one of them.	UCBzxaIDHk9wBZA8DDoIwjfQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBzxaIDHk9wBZA8DDoIwjfQ	0

Plus now there are plans than can kick even legal immigrants out if they've used any of our stuff like healthcare which btw is against the law to not use so basically if they didn't use health care they broke the law and we can kick them out but if they did use it that means we can kick them out, you do the math cause if I were in immigrant id also rather come illegally and try to keep a low profile	UCNk8yGWW_7Y_MbOpaXS5-Dw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNk8yGWW_7Y_MbOpaXS5-Dw	1	UgyUEdVl49fPvXdx65R4AaABAg	Holly Huffstutler

They also killed out the Clovis people the original inhabitants. All during the secind iceage land bridge time. Also tje keep on finding european fossils from that time.

But if your competing against someone for a job. And they under cut you and its the only reason why they get the job. Doesnt that seem unfair. Mexicans dont hurt the U.S. really? They fraud the tax system and social service system by having two ids most of the time. The high crime rate that comes along with the cartels and gangs. Brining in long dead viruses back into the population. The recent flu virus killing kids and adults that antibiotics cant kill. Increased inflation and taxes. Sending money back home instead of spend it here. For which needs to be stopped or taxed heavily. Literally the irs stating hispanic immagrants dont have to have proof of dependents. Thus further exploiting the tax system. Also a majority of hispanic immagrants do pay taxes period. So having a huge number of system exploiting aholes here does hurt the USA. Plus one other thing the us government actually give immagrants a free ride in college or universities. So to fix this. Non citizens cannot be employed or educated here. No right to vote own land or buy firearms. No acces to social services of any kind period no exceptions ever. Non citizens will be tagged with sub dermal tattoos. Marking them and tracking them. If the do get work they pay a 57 percent tax period no exceptions. Any employer caught not taking taxes out will be fined by 98 percent for that year. If non citizens purchase anything they have to be scanned. To tag the item for 58 percent tax increase no exceptions. See taking any form of freebie. No more come here. That and any child conceived outside the us is still a noncitzen no exceptions. If not properly reported 50 yr prison sentence of all involved. No exceptions. Its funny the mexician government has a zero tolerance illegal immagrant policy. They also don't allow immgrants to buy land either or vote. So please dont start thats not fair bs. If they can do it so can the USA.	UC3Er2M30_V0-4n2ZvKDEDLA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3Er2M30_V0-4n2ZvKDEDLA	1	UgyUEdVl49fPvXdx65R4AaABAg	Holly Huffstutler

Well since their employers dont report them on their taxes or have to pay benefits like healthcare. Aka cheap labor. And the immagrants also pay no taxes. Also since they pay no taxes they actually get payed more. So please do research before trying to sound edgyy. That's also not including immagrants dont have to have proof of dependents. Like americans have to plus pay taxes. Its funny im white work two jobs and go to school plus do lawn work. The song should immagrants we exploit the tax system and social service system. And commit violent crimes. Increase inflation and taxes on the people born in the U.S.. But hey most people who like junk believe fairy tales anyways. Also your type forget race quotas in employment and education and social services. So please think do immagrants actually put back as much into society as they take out? That be a big nope. Or i could say this "Immagrants if your country sucks tough shite" your not bringing that bs here and ruining this country. Grow some balls and fix your country were already full, go home no one cares.

And if you think about it were all from a family of immigrants because we all didn't originally live here except for like 0.1% of the world's population maybe even less.

The conditions that immigrants and refugees suffer through are appalling, and the stigma and hatred and stereotyping is almost worst.<br /><br />I did not earn my place in society. It was given to me by grace of my birth and my ancestry. How can anybody possibly claim that other people don&#39;t deserve the rights and freedoms that we take for granted simply due to where THEY were born? NOBODY CONTROLS WHERE THEY WERE BORN, FOLKS. You can&#39;t choose your heritage, you can only move forward and try to choose your future. In a perfect world, human rights would truly be internationally standard. Hopefully, someday, we can achieve that.<br /><br />I may not live to see that glory, but I will gladly join the fight.

Maybe people would stop immigrating illegally if doing it legally wasn‚Äôt nearly impossible if you have a specific nationality, and maybe, I don‚Äôt know, the phrase ‚Äúwe are all immigrants‚Äù isn‚Äôt about letting everyone in your country, but realizing that the USA was build by immigrants. It was the ‚Äúland of the freedom‚Äù for people that, for several reason, couldn‚Äôt stay in their own country. Also, Latin Americans aren‚Äôt the only ones that immigrate illegally or legally , so you wouldn‚Äôt be an ‚Äúextension of Latin America‚Äù but a combination of several cultures all over the world which, by the way, was what USA was founded in, freedom for everyone. Pity that such a great country with awesome ideals turn into such a racist place that you discriminate even your fellow Americans.

Nobody is saying they "hate immigrants", or hate the "idea of immigration". Americans don't want a massive flood of immigrants to keep illegally coming across the border. Period. That's it. Immigration of Europeans several hundred years ago does not mean every immigrant gets a free pass to come to the US when they so feel like it. Americans aren't racist for saying that. They aren't bigots. They aren't xenophobes. Americans do not want the US turning into an extension of Latin America. Every country has immigration laws. When you choose not follow them, then you are in fact committing an illegal offense and therefore should not be here. There is no argument against this.

Not for being illegals, but hating it in its purest form, hating the *idea*, that you should take a good look at yourselves. You may not be an immigrant being born in a country but your family line may very well be from another country. And no, I dont support illegal immigration. The sickest thing is that some people who oppose it also abuse it by taking in illegals and making them work like shit in unfair conditions with crap pay instead of trying to help them get registered or just do them a mercy and send them back.

"Everyone in America is an immigrant so lets let anyone who wants to come here to come here". Hahaha. First of all, if you were born in the US, you are not an immigrant. Second of all, the Spanish landed in what is now the US before the British did. Third of all, South and North America all had indigenous peoples prior to European arrival. Just because this happened doesn't mean that countries shouldn't have immigration laws, or that massive unfiltered immigration is a good thing in 2018. Dumb millennials thinking with their bleeding hearts and not their minds is what's hard to understand.

Plus the second iceage land bridge brought the native americans here. The came from indo china aka Siberia. Then they killed out the Clovis people the original inhabitants. Plus at the sametime a bunch of europeans came here before the indians. We keep in finding old European bones from that time that predate the indians. Not to mention indian legends of tall red headed people. Also one other thing if your born in a country your a native. Because if your going to use the native american method. Everyone born here is a native period.	UC3Er2M30_V0-4n2ZvKDEDLA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3Er2M30_V0-4n2ZvKDEDLA	1	UgzfNJhWsrb0Tl6M4xF4AaABAg	KaoriKameko

We are not immigrants. Immigrants move willingly. We didn't have a choice, but this is our country now. The history, language, music, wealth, infrastructure. We helped build that as they kept us in chains and stood on our backs. Our blood runs through it now. We are no immigrants. We created our own ethnic group right here after the knowledge of our ancestors' was beaten and whipped out of us. That whole "everyone is an immigrant in America," doesn't apply to us either. Our ancestors came from somewhere else, but we didn't immigrate here.	UCDIEam8QX500kQc_pjGtOlg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDIEam8QX500kQc_pjGtOlg	1	UgzfNJhWsrb0Tl6M4xF4AaABAg	KaoriKameko

Lets let all of MS 13 in and let the Middle East know were open for business, lets get some of those nice and friendly ISIS guys in here. While were at it, send some Somalies over to my house so they can fuck my wife. Once our taxes go up to 60% to pay for all the handouts and the massive amount of crime and building new prisons, the dollar will collapse and whites will be a minority, which should scare the fuck out of you because everyone hates whites. Go find an all Immigrant ghetto and walk through it alone, get back to me if you made it out. Not to mention they vote and vote hard left, ensuring that we will become a socialist disaster like Venezuela. Get some rabbits and start breeding them now because you're gonna need some protein when the communism starts. My founding father was a white immigrant in a white country. This country has been perverted since. Immigrants now don't assimilate and suck on welfare tit to the tune of hundreds of billions a year. We are 56% white if I remember correctly. Once we are 49% it's not The US anymore, it's Mexico. "Your founding father was literally an immigrant" is what brainwashed people who invite their own extinction say. If you read our history instead of CNN opinion pieces you will learn that we were never supposed to take in 40 million illegal immigrants and ensure a white minority.

The line was good, but jesus christ, it was just one throw-away line! This is not what Hamilton is about, not even slightly! If they wanted to make a song about immigrants, why couldn&#39;t they just make a song about immigrants? It&#39;s so annoying to me that they have to wait for something popular to mention the subject so they can be sure that they will cash in on its popularity rather than taking a risk and just writing about something they are passionate about. It feels so dishonest to me.	UCsRA6m1Z9g4AYhejAnJ3jZg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsRA6m1Z9g4AYhejAnJ3jZg	0

I think we should deport everyone who is subversive to the goals we have set out to achieve. You are all in for a big exit from our country.

Killing each other even inslavement too. We came and traded for quite a bit and even tried to coexist. But we didnt take their shite when they wanted to start a fight. So we pushed the aholes out. The irony is indians were nomadic. The settlers would move in no one around for hundreds of miles. Then after something gets built and profit starts coming in. Guess who shows up? The gibbs demanding their share. And every continent would still have problems because they refuse to unite and create and build a better future. Im sorry but trade for resources doesnt mean prosperity for all. Just the ones who work. Also other countries problems are theirs not the USA's.

You tell me, what would you do if you had all this piece of land but with people living in it who have a different language, different inferior technology, different spiritual belief and overall nearly different everything? Plus, the Native Americans would've just finished themselves off since they were already killing the rival tribes. Hell, if it weren't for the Europeans, the bloodshed between the tribes would've continued. What they did was morally wrong, but don't act like the Native Americans are innocent.

This had always been a problem but has gotten noticeable worse in the past few years. Most people, including myself, do not feel at all safe around police. I feel less threatened and intimidated by obvious gang members. 2)Public officials are highly corrupt. Not as bad as what you would find in Mainland China, but more akin to what you'd find in the South Korea of 20 years ago or Mexico. Japanese and Europeans are generally shocked at the level of corruption.

I'm a minority, I'm mixed race, hell, I'm not even White and this country has treated me well. I've had the same education as White people, my mother who is a minority recieves the same paycheck as her White friend and my dad who is currently fractured and a minority gets the same treatment as any other White man. The people who came to this country were not immigrants, in fact they were colonizers, they came here to colonize and establish their own land, not live in somebody else's land under somebody else's laws. They came to North America to conquer, not immigrate.	UC3-C9lkJJ32D6d75iLIkybw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3-C9lkJJ32D6d75iLIkybw	1	UgxhNKVjp39CO_gCZIN4AaABAg	Atarau Parr

It's only been great for the white but never the minorities so get your facts straight. And to go with what Grace Gary said yeah if it weren't for America a lot of countries wouldn't need fixing. Also America was a nation BUILT by the immigrants but now it's some how now a dirty word. even those that came in the Mayflower were immigrants, their descendants come from immigrants.

"Fix your own country"?? America and Britain has economically excluded and robbed countries of their resources and culture and people for centuries. And then you ignorantly shout "fix your own country"- if it weren't for America, a lot of countries wouldn't fucking need fixing. The idea you don't see the irony of saying this when America went through numerous of those wars while it's economy was built on the backs of slaves, underpaid, and prison labor, is entirely damning. You and others like you (like the idiot in chief) only enjoy calling countries shitholes because you're comfortable with never asking why they're seen as such. And yeah. That's being privileged.

No one wants a child working for them when they could have a competent adult work for them instead. Take the stick out of your ass and learn to act your age. I‚Äôm willing to bet that if you take one of those DNA tests you‚Äôd find that you aren‚Äôt nearly as white as you think you are.

They live behind the scenes doing the things the nobody else wants to do. Frankly all immigrants are treated like gum on the bottom of societies shoe, legal or illegal, they‚Äôre all treated the same. Most of us have ancestors that came over illegally, but now that America has been around for a couple hundred years we (the US) feel that immigrants are scum. Do you want to work in the fields picking food from before sunrise to after sunset? Do you want to loaded up on a bus and driven from field to field and never have a home? Do you want to be treated like a slave doing the dirty work that no one wants to do? Do you want to be beat up just because you‚Äôre talking to your family on the phone in your native language? All these things happen to legal immigrants, and illegal immigrants. Just because they weren‚Äôt born in our cesspool of a country they‚Äôre treated like shit. Let‚Äôs not forget that for individuals in DACA, becoming a citizen is illegal. Immigrants just want to survive and support their families, they might be escaping an abusive situation, they might be starving, their neighborhood might be a war zone. Everyone has their own reasons for fleeing, maybe if we made it so that there are less hoops to just through, people might actually do what they need to do to become a citizen. Immigrants don‚Äôt think white people are bad guys, despite the fact historically we are, they just want to have a mostly safe home for themselves and their families. Immigrants aren‚Äôt asking for your respect, and with the way you‚Äôre acting, you certainly won‚Äôt get theirs. Learn how to actually speak English and then maybe we‚Äôll talk more, but for now you‚Äôre acting like an entitled 12 year old.

You guys really think you'll¬†live in this utopian world where everyone love each other and everyone gets along and everyone is equal and blah blah blah. The truth of the matter is that discrimination and treating others as inferior didn't begin with the US. Even among the Italian immigrants, the Sicilians were looked at as inferior to "northern" Italians. There really wasn't any African migration. The Germans and Asians nobody really looked twice at. The Irish were of course treated poorly. So what's your point? Let anybody and everybody who wants to come here to just come? Just hugs and love and rainbows right? Haha yea ok.

First off, there was a time in American history where mass immigration was ok and encouraged. Just because it was ok 1911 doesn't mean that it's ok 2018. Mass unfiltered immigration from Latin America is not a good thing no matter how you try to spin it. Secondly, most Americans aren't hating on "immigrants of color"¬†because of their color. Americans actually care about their country and want their immigration laws enforced. Not because they "hate" Mexicans, but because they don't want their country to become some borderless extension of Latin America. Lastly, racism and prejudices is prevalent in all aspects of society, nationalities, races, etc. Humans have always been tribal in that way. Stop acting like the only people who exude racist thoughts or actions are white Americans. Blacks, Hispanics, Asians, and many others all harbor some racism and prejudices to some extent or another. Stop crying about something that you can't change and toughen up a bit.

Asian immigrant lives used to be considered worthless. Dr. Seuss for example had a real issue against Japanese and Chinese immigrants. Now Asians are not the target.

The old money tried to shit on them too. In Europe at least some people can say their families go back centuries, but even then they have no right to claim primacy, because we are ALL descended from immigrants, all the way back to Africa. It makes no sense to impose a hierarchy on such an arbitrary thing as someone's birthplace.

But most governments in the world do not give free things to illegal immigrants of those countries. I am a huge mix of ethnicities, of European identities and some Native to the USA. I agree that some of the outrage is legit against some of the white ancestors, but unfortunately in my experience it is not limited to that, but it is extended to all white people today. I can't tell you how often people try to shut me down by telling me that as a white man I cannot have an opinion. So I can agree that some white people in the past did horrible things. But so did people in the past of every culture, every skin color, all continents. I am all for anyone coming to the USA legally. The problem I have is when you try to legitimize illegal immigrants and give them things that people born in the USA don't even get. The world owes nobody anything because every people can trace their own history directly back to some oppression or another. Nobody owes anyone anything because of oppression suffered in the past unless you directly caused that oppression. And unfortunately my view stated above is not shared by most people talking about immigration.

But for example in my home my dad taught me that natives DID fight each other, you can see it in some movies even. But as you said a lot of people don't talk about that and it's true. And the hate towards whites is supposed to be to the ancestors of white people not of the whites today(unless if you agree with what they did back then). Unfortunately people take it out on others that had nothing to do with their ancestors actions. Besides if you haven't been outside the country and don't know irish people then you wouldn't know if the irish would do that or not :). You can't generalize. And same thing with the mexicans, usually people are very welcoming but as in every single country there is there is always going to be someone who is going to be against you being there/claiming ancestry. But my point was that it is sad that they have to call people illegal when america was just a contintent before and not seen as a "country" where people get called illegals or tell them "go back to your country" When they actually are on their land. But people don't see it that way because they want people to be as the "US is today". I hope you don't get offended but I just want people to hear another perspective because Im an immigrant myself and sometimes those things hurt. Have a good day!

I just can't get too worked up over it since the only time people care about slavery or land stealing is when they can blame whites. But when Natives do it to Natives, well that doesn't get talked about. I was born in the USA, I have never lived in another country. So how am I not a native? Because of my skin color? If you want to come to the USA, do it legally. We should welcome legal immigrants who wan to come and assimilate to the melting pot that the USA today is. Thats all I'm saying. If you want to come, come, but do it legally. Because if I suddenly wanted to live in Ireland and claimed Irish ancestry, Ireland would tell me to fuck off and wouldn't just let me in and set me up with a house and government assistance. Neither would Russia. Germany. Sweden. Mexico sure wouldn't do that either. Everyone gets the same standards. That is equality, and that means if some people have to pass a test to get in, so should everyone else, regardless of skin color, religion, nationality, or country of origin. The same standards for everyone, and unfortunately that is not what I am seeing today.

Being the decendant of a legal immigrant, or immigrants, is not a privilege. Illegal immigrants struggle, but bottom line is there are avenues to help people come to the USA legally. And evne if you are here illegally that doesn't always stop you. I had a coworker from Jamaica who ended up staying beyond her visa, and she ended up getting citizenship after, so its not like its impossible to become a citizen. Its hard, but possible. Look at the rest of the world and see just how hard it is for people to legally immigrate. Well, except if you aren't white and want to move to the EU. They will pay you to come then, but most nations in the world are not like that.

For once, all you guys doing is screaming the word &quot;racist&quot; with no fact to back up your irreverence all because you don&#39;t like what you hear nor what you see. Then afterward, you continuing gibberish your way out of this type of argument for attention, and to avoid getting your feeling hurts. <br /><br /> Immigrant, especially the hard-working Europeans are what built this country, but that was the past, also the matter of fact is that, in this modern world, all of illegal immigrant and some immigrant are mainly done nothing to benefits this country except draining it out and make it weak. Because otherwise why is it the only Mexican and few Central &amp; South American are the only one who like to bitch &amp; moans? It&#39;s because they want to live off the government to sit on theirs fat-ass and buying phone, beers, 70&quot; TV, free education, free ride, and free healthcare while all of hard working American of all race cannot receive it due of broken Democratic governs positions. <br /><br />You all can go ahead and posting whatever the BS you have found on internet to copy &amp; paste here, but you cannot outsmart me nor beat my excellent knowledge over how system work.

Many people are against them (especially in my country) because we see what happens in other countries (rapes, terrorists attacks and such). I don&#39;t want to be afraid of living in my own country but then I think - what if one day I would have to run away from my home?<br />Our law sometimes sucks (you raped and killed someone? - Ok, you&#39;ll get a smaller punishment than the person who was trying to protect themselves and accidentally hurt their robber) and if it was improved we could minimalize bad things from happening (now I&#39;m writing about people in genereal, not immigrants only). People wouldn&#39;t live in fear and would be more willing to help others.<br /><br />I&#39;m sorry if I made any mistakes or didn&#39;t express myself clearly enough. I wanted to write more, but it&#39;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_35a7sn6ds&amp;t=23m50s">23:50</a> plus English is not my native language.<br />Have a good night :)<br />...or day.

They were¬†also killing each other¬†off way before the arrival of any European.¬†The land and everything in it goes to the taker.¬†To the strongest. There's no shame in that and I don't¬†feel shit for any "Native American" still crying about it¬†500+ years later.

Who says who can be here and who can't?? The actual citizens of this country do. And please spare me the "Native Americans were here first" crap. Are you really that naive to believe that mass immigration, legal or illegal, have no affect on the US or it's citizens?? Traffic? Crime? Population increase? Larger ghettos? More social welfare art the expense of the tax payer?? Lol yea ok. If your only argument is "they do the jobs nobody else wants", or " but they pay taxes", or my personal favorite "but all Americans are immigrants", then you have already lost this argument. This isn't your 8th grade social debate class kid. Come back when you got an actual argument as to why I should not give a fuck about a bunch of undocumented people illegally crossing into my country. I'm sure in your world of rainbows, hugs, and unicorns we can all get along and love these poor Hispanics who just wan't a 'better life", but we still have a country to run and things like illegal immigration have a bigger negative impact than you can probably comprehend at your age.

Some of the people that call for that kind of stuff tend to be illegal immigrants themselves or be th r children of illegals. I've heard plenty of absurd ideas about our borders.

However, we shouldn't just completely open the borders on the fear of being discriminatory.

They blame illegal immigrants for bringing in drugs when it&#39;s actually themselves who are doing it. I mean, most of the drugs come from china, which Americans buy online and sell to other people. Most illegal immigrants are trying to escape the country because they have to escape someone or something desperately. And if they go back, they&#39;ll die.

My field is science and healthcare and immigrants also perform important roles. They serve as lab techs, post-docs, scientists, physicians, nurses, pharmacists, nursing assistants, health care aides, etc. The list goes on. Especially in underserved areas of the country such as inner cities and rural areas. If people ever want to see a multi-cultural team, even in the center of the country, go visit a hospital, clinic, nursing home, or university. Ironically, some of the geographic areas of the US that support strict immigration rules have seen / would see their healthcare system collapse.

The guy in the middle is wearing scrubs.

They hire people based off how hard working they are. So if you want colleges to accept you and get hired, work hard and prove you can do the job. There is a lot of white privilege in America, it depends where you live. Some places have more of it than others. But where I live there is a lot of it. It's okay to be White, and it's okay to be from whatever and have whatever. What's not okay is being racist, ignorant, rude, etc. It depends on the person not the race. But that was besides the point, the point is white privilege is very real even if some people can't see it.

It irks me to hear/read people refer to USA as &#39;America&#39;, America is a continent, if you were born in it, you are American. Unite States OF America. Residente always representing, but I have to say that in order to get that message to the ones that you want to hear it, you need to say it in their language, or else it&#39;d be like your message was just air, the message was great, I loved it, but that&#39;ll go over the heads of many Trump like people because it&#39;s in &quot;Mexican&quot;. Half the USA used to belong to Mexico, it was stolen from the Mexican people, sadly, by its own president, sold cheap to the USA. &quot;We plant the tree so you can eat the fruit&quot;.

But some Middle eastern prefer calling themselves middle eastern (such as myself). It's not that we don't like so call ourselves Asians, its just that some people don't see it. Like once someone asked which continent I was from and I said Asia then they said 'but you don't look Asian', so I just started saying middle eastern. But its also that when we say Middle Eastern people understand the region. Most people that I know see Asia as China, Japan, and Korea, but nothing else which is really stupid. Some people don't understand that those aren't the only countries in Asia. So yea it's not that we don't want to be called Asian it's just that the people around us want us to say Middle Eastern.

Also, lol what do you mean nobody would support you emigrating to the usa? It's not like immigrants of colour would try to argue that you're taking jobs away from them when they didn't even have it in the first place. White, brown, black, yellow: everyone emigrates to the US for a better life, not to be discriminated against. Immigrants of colour know that especially, so don't think for a second they discriminate against you because you're white. Nobody cares that you're white. You wanna follow rules, that's fine, it's your choice. Generalising white-hate? Still your choice. But not cool. So not cool.

There are more POC than whites in DC and also in NYC and many other cities. But POC get so little representation and everything is whitewashed there, giving a misguided view. In India, it is usually like 95% Indians in every state and city so white people don't need to be included in our shows to correctly represent our country. Same for most Asian countries. To correctly represent America, whites, blacks, latinos and all the other races have to be included. Also, I'm Indian so I know what I'm talking about when it concerns my country.

This song spoke to me on such an emotional level making me think about my dad, who himself came illegally and met my mom. He worked day in and day out sometimes only seeing my mom for a meal and then leaving again. He got his papers and now is a proud¬†US citizen¬†working for the U.S government. I&#39;m sitting here in this office listening to this song and just started crying. I&#39;m so thankful to have been raised by both my mother and father who have worked day in and day out to provide for me. This is truly one of those songs that just touches the heart.

These laws are in place at the state and federal levels to maintain some sort of semblance of peaceful and orderly society. Immigration goes a far beyond "having a better life". It has an effect on the population, pollution, money, health services, police services, crime, culture, etc. Having mass unfiltered immigration doesn't help anyone. I'm sorry that they born into shit hole countries, but the US isn't dumping ground for people who don't want to live in their country anymore. If they wan't to be a citizen, then they need to go through the proper channels. The LEGAL way. Secondly and lastly, my wife was an immigrant to this nation. She did what SO MANY other immigrants refused to do or couldn't do. Learn English and become a citizen legally by working 3 jobs to pay for it. Whether you agree of how the US became a nation or not, we still are a nation and it's the job of our citizens and government to protect ourselves and our way of life. It is not our job to protect all of Latin America's ex pats who can't cut it in their country anymore, or the one's who "dream of a better life".

I remember at 5 years old knowing who ICE was and what they did. I saw my parents being mistreated and called ‚Äúwetbacks‚Äù because they weren‚Äôt legal or didn‚Äôt know English.

Imagine coming to an unknown place with nothing and a language you don't even understand but you still work hard and sometimes harder than the people that live in America. My grandma left my mom and my uncle behind, and came with nothing just to work and build a better life for her family. If you don't know a person's situation, don't say whether or not someone deserves to get deported or not.

I my country, Chile (which become the perfect place for lots of immigrants) the discrimination is huge. Lots of immigrants are bullied and blamed because &quot;they are making our community sick&quot; which is not true. Is disgusting to see all that discrimination to persons looking for a better life...the thing that they don&#39;t know is that they make the hard job because the rich doesn&#39;t want to get dirty.<br /><br />Immigrants, we get the job done Chile.

Other countries who know of the massive refugee immigration can see just how bad it is for such an overhaul to occur. I would like for immigrants to come here legally though , but that if they have a serious reason for illegally comming to the USA then that&#39;s ok too. I feel that population counting of immigrants is needed and the illegal ones make it harder for us to aid them in getting proper jobs, shelter, and an education so they don&#39;t become lower class lackies to big companies. BUT WITH HOW CRAZIES ARE VIEWING THEM AS &quot;STEALING OUR JOBS&quot; THEN CRAP MAY NEVER GET DONE BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE TOO AFRAID O REPORT THEY&#39;RE HERE! Diseases and illicit trade are two big issues that legal immigrants pass that illegal ones don&#39;t. Although, this video is talking about how immigrants take the labor jobs of the USA and get underpaied and arrested for it while rich companies that use these immigrants as pawns gets off scott free.

But just putting one race or ethnicity in charge is not going to make anything easier. <br />If we do that, there&#39;s going to be a huge uprising from a lot of people. We have a weak government, but it&#39;s only the corrupted people who run it. Our government is strong otherwise, because guess who built it? Immagrints.<br />Now, I&#39;m not saying immigration is good. I&#39;m also not hating on it. The people in these comments do not realize how much immigration effects the economy. It has good effects, but also slowly breaks it down. Legal immigration is perfectly fine, but illegal immigration is not wrong, but not great. What I&#39;m really trying to say is: America is not the land of the free, and it will never be no matter how many solutions you give.

Just look at us in Europe the immigrants here literally despise us. I mean we quite literally have blood on our streets every week now, they murder us for the crime of not being muslim they rape women because they are not muslim they refuse to follow our laws have their own courts and commit horrific amounts of crime just look at the stats huge amounts are open isis supporters who even have protests and yet we are still called racist and xenophobic. Tell me how many muslims mexico has taken in?? what about japan? what about brazil? what about angola??? oh that is right fuck all yet they love do demand free entry to our countries and label us racist whilst not doing anything themselves when the capital of mexico is less then 50 percent Mexican when they are crushed beneath the truck of a jihadist then they can have the right to act as they do now but only then.

Is it taxes your assuming we don't pay? We do. In fact, fun fact, not only are taxes payed when you purchase things like anyone else, but most illegal immigrants have to go do their taxes every year knowing they will never get a cent back. Maybe I'm just not understanding your point, please make it clearer. I'm not trying to fight, I'm defending. Everyone can have their own opinions, yes, but when those opinions are hurting a community, don't we have a right to understand why that is and to defend ourselves? I'm not talking politics, I'm just talking about an image that damages me and mine.

Or men risking their lives and risking getting deported, just so they can jump into a complete strangers truck so that they can fix someone's dry wall for 10-20 bucks. Maybe the housekeeper, who's back is ruined, has crippling arthritis, gets accused of things she didn't commit, and can't get the day off even when she's got pneumonia... yeah. Immigrants don't steal jobs. We do the things no one else wants to do. The US agricultural picking has always been done by slaves, and then immigrants. We've always been here, every country in the world runs on underpaid immigrant work, look it up.

Usually it&#39;s cause they think that it&#39;s about illegal immigrants but they are actually talking about immigrants in general so both legal and illegal. The crossing the borders is the same for both parties. Both get deported. Both get jobs American born citizens don&#39;t want and both don&#39;t get the credit they deserve. Oh well.

Killed. Raped. Used their trust and learned how to do the skills that it took years for the native Americans to learn, and then killed them all. Ok, so that&#39;s fine, we&#39;re ok.

If they were only against illegal immigration, they would make it easier for people to immigrate legally, bit they just put so many obstacles and conditions, to keep "inferior" people out.

My father came here first on a work visa while my mother fixed our documents. We all came here and were later made permanent residents by amnesty in the 80s. I grew up to serve my country. I, too, got the job done. I became an American citizen. And dear god I&#39;ve never felt so hurt by what&#39;s going on in this country. I fought for us, i believed in us!! What is happening?

And I&#39;m saying this coming from a family of many, many colors: Why don&#39;t people realize that saying &quot;white racists&quot; is racist in of itself? My dad is Mexican-German and he&#39;s racist against Mexicans. He thinks we should &quot;Build that wall!&quot; just as much as the next Trump supporter. It&#39;s the mindset that other humans can be lower than you, ALSO a human, that makes a person racist. NOT the color of their skin. You yourself are being racist if you group racism into a problem of just one race.<br /><br />Also, side note: WHY DO WE GROUP POEPLE INTO RACES AND COLORS OF THEIR SKIN? It&#39;s literally just science. It&#39;s the amount of melanin in your skin. That&#39;s it. It&#39;s does not define who you are or who you will be. Never let your so called &quot;race&quot; hold you back.	UC-68h9zDIi3iEVftIvhTv2A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-68h9zDIi3iEVftIvhTv2A	0

There&#39;s really not that many jobs, lots of people can&#39;t get any &amp; often when people come they don&#39;t have housing or money or food and are mistreated. It doesn&#39;t really sound like the land of opportunity. Who do people want to be here?	UCKcjCT0ppCiinFXY4BaoT9w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKcjCT0ppCiinFXY4BaoT9w	0

Immigrant households consume more cash, food, and Medicaid dollars than native households, while housing costs are roughly the same for both groups. Figure 1 shows that Medicaid is the largest welfare program, driving a large part of the overall difference between immigrants and natives.

Instead of trying to shut out everyone, fix the immigration system and make it more helpful to those coming from places that are dangerous and need help instead of spending so much money for things that aren&#39;t as necessary. Also, to everyone claiming that immigrants are rapists and drug dealers, there are more white people who were born in America who kill and rape more than anyone else here. You wanna kick all the white citizens out too? One more thing- not all illegal immigrants are Latin American! You&#39;re looking for excuses to be racist.

Europeans do not meaning there are many Mexicans out there that would be considered "white" by European standards knowing nothing better to classify them as. many would be considered mixed race and many native American. I do not care if Mexicans want to invade the usa and recreate the Mexican empire, what I care about is how they clearly want this and are hostile to the usa whilst at the same time as doing this they claim they are all friendly, hard working, law-abiding, and can integrate into the usa with loyalty to the country. but no they do not do that they declare hostility like this comment and song and then dare call all americans who oppose your entry racist or paranoid when it seems to be by the actions and words of the Mexican people the American worries are fully legitimate! you can not have it both ways Mexico pick one.

It began as a war of attrition that American field commanders were willing to escalate into a war of annihilation. Hostilities officially ceased in late October of 1847, and the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, signed on February 2, 1848, formally ended the conflict. The U.S. War on Mexico secured Texas as part of the southern empire of slavery and took another 1,370,154 square kilometers (529,017 square miles) of land, nearly half of the original territory of Mexico, as spoils of war. Including the land of the Spanish cession and the annexation of Texas, by 1848 the U.S. had expropriated a total of 2,567,111 square kilometers (almost one million square miles) of land from its southern neighbors. They forced us to give it up	UC8tJ6AWQO7BfxKFeMOmnlmg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8tJ6AWQO7BfxKFeMOmnlmg	1	UgyWy7PDu_SEvoP-oS94AaABAg	Meg

Before the Europeans arrived multiple tribes had claims to the North American Southwest like the Pueblo, Hopi, and even the Aztecs. The Spanish took control over a lot of that area when they arrived. The area was retaken from Spain by Mexican colonists and Natives in 1822. Then we had Americans agreeing to settle in Texas. Texas has it's secession movement and later joins the US. Then you have a war instigated by President Polk where the US took territories like California, Utah, Nevada, New Mexico, and Arizona from Mexico. Imperialism is a big complicated mess.

Even white people. &#39;Right of conquest&#39; is people claiming a higher power granted them higher worth and there fore power over others, meaning they, by the wishes of this higher power, deserve this land. Insane, right? Which means anyone should be able to immigrate, and no one coming here should be illegal, right? <br /><br />Wrong. The influx of immigrants actually does hurt the economy, and while they do help with jobs, it makes it so that legal citizens in lower places have difficulty getting jobs, as well as safety for those immigrants. So the best decision would be to loosen immigration laws and make it easier to reach first world countries. Sadly, here in the United States, that seems not to be happening any time soon, especially with Trump&#39;s plans that may leave this nation in a bit of a tangle.

K&#39;naan&#39;s verse lacked any sort of actual flow and was mixed so poorly it was hard to hear. Snow&#39;s verse was...ok. It started off strong and she varied her rhythms, but as it closed out it became stale. Riz, as a rapper I highly enjoy and relate to, disappointed me. His flows were slow and clunky, sometimes it sounded like he was offbeat, all in all, a half-assed job. I knew Residente would be fantastic, he was fantastic, fantastic. The beat itself was nocturnal but in a bad way. It failed to convey the emotions presented in the song and sounded more like a club beat. The drums and the rest of the mix in general either had serious mixing problems (my guess) or the beat overpowering vocals/dropping dead silent was on purpose (i hope not). I wanted a song about immigrants done by immigrants to be good. I really did. This didn&#39;t do it.	UCgLDsqmoOJKnCJDPFtAutvQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgLDsqmoOJKnCJDPFtAutvQ	0

I came here to talk about the claim "immigrants, we get the job done" The United States defeated the Nazi's and not a single immigrant was in our military. We the American people get the job done that's why immigrants want to come here. If immigrants were so end all be all they would fix their own countries not come to already established countries.

It&#39;s not always a race thing, yes I understand there will always be hate, but from where I&#39;m talking about, it&#39;s less about race and more about people. How can we let others in and allow them jobs and housing hookups when we can&#39;t even fix up broken neighborhood&#39;s qnd streets or education the homeless enough to get them a stable job. We need to take care of the people that are already here before we take on anyone else, because if we can&#39;t care for ourselves, how are we supposed to take on other&#39;s? That&#39;s being irresponsible. It&#39;s like being a parent, if you can&#39;t take care of one or two children, don&#39;t keep having more and more, because how will they fend for themselves and come out as dependable people if you fail?

It&#39;s like some generic K Slay mix... K&#39;naan drops some random metaphors about America even though he&#39;s Canada and Snow Da Product sounds like bitchy lesbian angry for no reason. The lyrics are pretty awful and the repetitive phrase &quot;immigrants: we get the job done&quot; gets tired really quick. I was hoping they could share some immigrant stories or talk about xenophobia or how the immigrants are leaking into the cracks of Western society. But, they did none of that. They just kept repeating some dumb line &quot;immigrants: we get the job done&quot; behind some awful dubstep mix. The only reason this song has 2 million views is because of Lin Manuel&#39;s star-strutted Hamilton mixtape. If you want to listen to a REAL Hip-Hop song about immigration, check out Guante&#39;s &quot;Welcome to the Border&quot; or Oddisee&#39;s &quot;Lifting Shadows&quot; or CMA &quot;The Immigrant&quot; but definitely not this trash!

I had one who didn&#39;t even know how to boil water....boil fucking water! Many of them can not even understand or speak English. They are not qualified, lack skills and sit on welfare when they realize that they don&#39;t have to work at all to stay in our countries. The arrogance of this video and the people in it makes me want these fucker killed at the border. Here&#39;s the real question.....if our nation is attacked how many of these people would fight and die for our countries, and how many of them would just leap frog to a country that isn&#39;t at war? I love my country and would die for her and I have worked hard all my life....so fuck you and this shitty song and video!

I had to leave israel from a high conflict area at a young age purely for safety. but as i travelled around looking for permanent residence i encountered so many things. i was in germany for years which was good considering my whole family knows the language, but when i was in places like USA and sweden i had no clue what i was doing. now that I&#39;m settled i decided to dedicate my life to helping kids through that language barrier. i&quot;m now fluent in spanish and arabic despite never having lived in a spanish or arabic country (i knew a bit of arabic from my childhood though) and 4 other languages. i teach kids english courses from around the world and when i save up enough money I&#39;m going to open up centers for english learning. i started helping adults as well when i was in germany and giving them language is like giving life in a sense. i help break a lot of barriers and stereotypes about israelis, and change people&#39;s lives. us immigrants are the most driven people, legal or not, to change the world	UC62iVxO3AvHSIUMNR-nEFlQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC62iVxO3AvHSIUMNR-nEFlQ	0

That&#39;s the problem, I&#39;m flattered that you trust my country this much. It&#39;s just, you broke the law. <br /><br />And before you call me a racist Donald Trump supporter, Donald Trump isn&#39;t all bad. Yes, he does discriminate and he is mean, which is a terrible thing, but he does do slightly good. <br /><br />I accept everyone, even if you are illegally in my country. What&#39;s hard to accept is that you complain, but you&#39;re the one who broke the law. <br /><br />Yes, I know there are struggles, but it&#39;s the law. It&#39;s a rule put in place that many, many, people have debated, some of them not even Donald Trump supporters. Heck, this rule was in place before Donald Trump. <br /><br />Anyway, I&#39;m sorry if I offended anyone, I&#39;m just stating my opinion. I do not mean to be rude, racist or disrespectful in anyway.

Can you tell me that you follow every traffic sign or law there is. If not, you're breaking the law. Mostly all of the immigrants that come here illegally come here for a better life. Becoming a citizen of the united states or entering the us isn't as easy as people think. It takes lots (and lots) of money and time that not a lot of people have especially coming from third world countries. It's easier to come here illegally but again even that takes money and a lot of risks. I'm not saying it's right but I am not saying it is wrong. As long as the people who come here aren't hurting anyone, what makes the laws you break different from the laws that they break? And people do "complain" whenever they aren't treated like people. Illegal or not, it's not right.	UCfaNApZFr1T4cRtB0U5sTZg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfaNApZFr1T4cRtB0U5sTZg	1	Uggxe4_IX7dA4XgCoAEC	Chloe E

UggmUeTMENiORHgCoAEC	0	1	2017-07-28 14:05:56	Jonida San√ßo	When I was only 4 years old my family and I lived as immigrants, only for a year, but it was the most important year of my whole life. My parents worked the worst jobs to support my sister&#39;s hospital expenses and our livelihoods. We lived in a house without electricity with several other people in their 20s also making their ends meet. It was my most formative year as I made my first memories as an immigrant. I will never forget what it is to be an immigrant, what heroes my parents were to cross the border with insecurity, with young children, without knowing the language, living family behind. I will never forget the most amazing people from the hospital or our neighborhood who helped us out. I will never forget the racist comments my parents had to face, even though I was too young to understand back then. Legal or illegal, immigrants get the job done, and they have supported economies all around the world. They&#39;re the ones who are willing to go one step too far to give their children a better life. Anyone who doesn&#39;t understand that, is either shallow or they&#39;re lying to themselves, repeating the same dogma by the rich who want to keep immigration illegal so they can keep exploiting immigrants in undocumented jobs, or in prison where they stay for a while before really being deported.

Illegal immigrants in America are the most abused people there, they get paid less than minimum wage under the table since they can&#39;t legally have a job, they are getting kicked out and spat on by american people, and they don&#39;t pay taxes meaning they aren&#39;t a contribution to the society, I know it is tough to live as an illegal immigrant, I have a lot of friends who are in this terrible position. But really we should realize that being a legal is much easier. Just saying though, it&#39;s my opinion and I&#39;m free to take criticism unless it&#39;s shit like &quot;AahaAsaAAaaAaaAAA yOu&#39;rE a FcKN tRumP supPoRTEr!11!!&quot;	UChbdDRbTjOwMJ1vqU0YOZBg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UChbdDRbTjOwMJ1vqU0YOZBg	0

UggU0irAxfDDi3gCoAEC	0	0	2017-07-28 12:02:31	Brandon Henderson	From watching this video, I get the context, but fail to see the message it&#39;s trying to send. I feel as though it&#39;s more of a message that our society is going back to where it was YEARS ago (as far as social structure), and I get it, it feels like the U.S.A. is starting to get that &quot;closed off&quot; type of social standard that we had back in the 1700&#39;s-1960 that was broken by the &quot;peace/hippie&quot; movement back in the 70&#39;s. I fear however, that the lower/middle class won&#39;t learn from the past and just start a &quot;revolution&quot; that will only move to force larger political powers, to take a more conservative stand and pass legislation to contain said &quot;revolution&quot;. Being that the lower/middle class is well varied and educated, it&#39;s safe to say that a majority of us understand that none of us actually come from the U.S.A., and that being an &quot;American&quot; just means that you <br />have interests in Westernized social structure (human rights, morals, etc.). So I propose that instead of having a revolution in the &quot;streets&quot;, we citizens should focus on conforming and taking over the higher political powers by pushing for more advanced education in the impoverished areas and standardizing our society on understanding (Ex. &quot;You and I are human let&#39;s work together&quot;) and exploration (Ex. &quot;This city is next to a beautiful river where the f*** is our tourism&quot;).

To make a few extra bucks to support their loved ones. And when they get here they are treated badly and stereotyped, when most mind their own business follow laws, take the jobs that other ppl don&#39;t want but that we need done, and get paid horribly. I also don&#39;t get how when some ppl finally get legal they hate the illegal even tho they where once illegal as well.<br /><br />Oh by the way I am Hispanic and born in New Jersey. And of fear of getting treated badly I never say I am unless asked specifically and since I have light skin I look white since my English is perfect 	UCbIRxVXHtyJG5OcBFnQtyNg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbIRxVXHtyJG5OcBFnQtyNg	0

My dad worked his ASS off and was never home, working 3 jobs to try and get enough money so he wouldn't have to live off disability. My parents never used welfare, my mom worked 6 am - 6 pm everyday. My parents worked so hard for every dime and saved, taught me not to spend. I have a rare eye disorder named Congenital Hypertrophy of the Retinal Pigment Epithelium, and my parents NEVER took charity. They payed for every surgery themselves, my dad working on roofs and selling shit on ebay. He became a construction worker, and he worked so much he needed knee surgery (which we couldn't afford). My parents worked so hard for me. My dad was an illegal alien who is fully legal now. Immigrants, we get the job done.

Honestly I don&#39;t think YouTube cares about likes and dislikes, I&#39;m pretty sure they only look at the view count so thank you for the added 7K views!!!!! In the end immigrants will still be here wether you like it or not because take a look at the mirror, it&#39;s you who is the immigrant (unless you were here before the time that America came to be) and you guys seem to not want to move back home to where you actually belong. You say we&#39;re the ones who are stubborn and are doing all that we can to stay here (such as staying here &quot;illegally&quot; by U.S. law) but we&#39;re just trying to fit back on the land we live on. This U.S. soil is not yours. All of us immigrants have earned our right to be here and I have yet to see a racist person who has worked just as hard as an immigrant does for the United States. We support and are the foundation of the U.S. and without us, likes house, you will fall apart. <br /><br />P.S. If I hear one more person tell a Latino that lives or is from South AMERICA that they are not an American I&#39;m going to pull out a map and show them the Western Hemisphere, if they even have enough intelligence to know what that is (a third grader would know), and yell &quot;THIS LAND IS CALLED THE AMERICAS&quot;	UCSB6jbu5t2_jxqAPC8vyiVg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSB6jbu5t2_jxqAPC8vyiVg	0

Yes, even those that came in the Mayflower were immigrants, their descendants come from immigrants. Colonizers, are too since the land actually did not belong to them. The Americas had their own native peoples that were brutally conquered others were unwilling immigrants for they were sold as slaves and indentured servants. The truth is within all of you.

Hamilton was in the colonialist camp and believe that unchecked immigration is a policy of national suicide as it willingfully invites individuals who have 1) split loyalties 2) hold different value systems contrary to the american founding stock and thus founding character. 3)that it expressely prevent meaningful assimilation to the general american culture. The only difference that hamilton has with the other founding fathers is that he followed a camp of thought that focused on the aspect of civic nationalism that concluded in his prognosis on immigration while others feared that non-whites could not assimilate due to their nature and genetics, hamilton and john adams believes that non-whites could, but their assimilation should be thorough and complete and that their number should be heavily limited until they adapt a "protestant englishman nature"	UCCC7NfLF4IKJBvCXKhJ7lSw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCC7NfLF4IKJBvCXKhJ7lSw	1	UggQnlvc5C1cUngCoAEC	Wanda Ferrer

If you have ever heard of the Second Immigrant Wave, you would know the true origin of this problem. Many Second Wave immigrants who were turned away or discouraged were Northern and Western Europeans, those of which were hailing from Ireland and Italy, however the current "Americans" were really not wanting to come because they were doing so well for themselves and having to share the pot with other people would take away from what they have. They did this not knowing that the reason that they were having their jobs "stolen" was because the people to pay them was more than happy to be richer by paying a Irish man less than half of what any "American" would be willing to be paid. Do you know what the kicker is? They were all 100% white, so your statement means nothing. Either you descended from an immigrant or you descended from the monopolistic leaders who created this sort of caste system that is still here today. If you want to know when the whole "Illegal Immigrant" thing really happened look up America 1849. You will see the California Gold Rush and see that those immigration restraints were put in place because the gold, that was barely there, could be taken by other people. Oh no, but this belongs to the Americans, but at that time so long as you come here and begin a life here you are technically American. You can find out the rest on your own, so long as you take the time to read this long history lesson.

Bringing to light how immigrants work different levels instead of victimizing them all by saying they all are working in terrible conditions. It also combats the stigma that they are all lazy freeloaders that want to take advantage of the system. Both are common trips you see in the media.

Sadly is hard to make people dance while educating them. Respect 4 this track	UChwYt5mwX1Ctk-IK6VyhHQg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UChwYt5mwX1Ctk-IK6VyhHQg	0

We are here to support american values, America was built with immigrants and we would not be where we are today without them.

They come here to start a new life. Thats why there are so many immigrants. That&#39;s why so many keep coming. That&#39;s why they &quot;steal your job&quot; because they have to support themselves and family. Try to do that once in your life.

Your leaving your family, your friends, your language and your culture and being thrown into a society where you have no one to turn to for help. And while it can be argued that depending on where your coming from, or the colour of your skin, some immagrants may have an easier time than others. But regardless, please don't undermine any immagrants struggle. You don't know this kid's background, financial status or his face. You can't make a the claim that he is privileged or not.

This video is too powerfull, it has La Bestia, it includes SANDINO, FUCK, MY DAD WAS IN THAT WAR, damn, this is just. I am a full latin in a country full of the people that stole my ancestors their land, a country that lives in our territory and still gets to fucking spit in my face.

UgjpNcmar9C6H3gCoAEC	1	2	2017-07-23 06:20:00	lysared	My mother spent some time in refugee camps in Germany, back in the sixties. First, they were put into camps because my family had a Jewish name. Then, because they had German heritage. My mother was born in the middle of the last part.<br />My mother did her degrees and now pays maximum tax (because she is self-employed).<br />The reason she got there was that the party in power at the time felt that people should be able to go to school. Before that, my mother had to clean houses, do any job she could find, but they gave a grant to disadvantaged youths. So she was able to get the diploma. And go on to study, which is free in my country.<br />I grew up with the knowledge that you cannot take any of this for granted.<br />And still, I was privileged. Both my parents have degrees.<br />I noticed the difference when I went to University and saw how differently people from less fortunate background didn&#39;t know how to be confident in that environment.

His entire discography actually (being Calle 13) has a lot of songs with strong political lyrics. If you liked this video I highly recommend you the song "Latinoam√©rica", it's practically a himn to all of us. Saludos desde M√©xico herman@.

I&#39;m not saying I&#39;m not okay with them but illegal immigrants I have a tiny problem. Not a big one but a small tiny one. Illegal immigrants are coming over and are on food stamps from the state because they can&#39;t get a card or anything to buy food. I understand that some immagrants are coming over to better their lives for their families and I respect that. I&#39;d do the same thing but when they come over, we have to pay for it with our money and that&#39;s the problem. If we as Americans can somehow stop the taxation of food stamps, I would have no problem with illegal immigrants	UCs6FMNW7KVuS10lfSIVdQaA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs6FMNW7KVuS10lfSIVdQaA	0

Most immigrants are deport for stupid crimes like their brake light is out or they&#39;re walking around late at night. Women &amp; families that come here for asylum are put in sententious center in Texas run like prisons. Private owned &amp; most of the time they don&#39;t get the help they need. Most of them return home to the hell they were experiencing back home because it&#39;s better than being locked in all day. People treat immigrants like criminals, but they come for a better life. Yeah there are some bad seeds in the mix, but it outweighs the fact that they put that food on your table. Whether it&#39;s at home or at a restaurant or in the supermarket or at a farmers market the chances are that you are buying what an immigrant helped make, pick, or plant.

Second, you say that you or your father don't want to kill us, that's great, you guys aren't what the "racists" are worried about(well, most of them anyway). What we are worried about are terrorist attacks across the West. Europe has had issues in Sweden with rape, London with terrorists, and France with more terrorists. Do we really want to risk the security of our country by allowing access for people like that? That puts a danger to millions, you included. Third, you say its hard to get citizenship. I agree. So instead of perpetuating a break-the-law/give-amnesty system that is riddled with flaws, why not make it as easy as possible for non-violent immigrants to legally go through the system? Would this compromise work. Non-violent immigrants can enter easier, while we ensure that violent ones remain out?

You‚Äôre more likely to be killed by some crazy white dude with a gun who claims the 2nd amendment right. I‚Äôm sorry for not being afraid of the latino dude or the gal with the brown skin, but being afraid of the white guy. When you‚Äôre born into a country and you think you belong there and no one else does? I‚Äôm sorry, but my dad was never here to attack you. He was here for a job, to make a family, he was illegal, but he, like so many came here to live a peaceful life under the radar. Those white truckers? That 40% of white people that think they‚Äôre better than me and my family? They‚Äôre the dangerous ones. I would never kill them, I would never harass them. But they think my dad should be deported simply because my family wasn‚Äôt born here. Coming to American legally is so hard, and some people can‚Äôt afford the literal years it takes to gain refugee from a repressive system, or to go to college, or to get a good job. That‚Äôs BS what you‚Äôre saying. Literally, the chance of being strangled by your bedshirts is greater than being killed by a foreign born terrorist. You have literally have twice the chance of being killed by a white terrorist.	UCpvXL-Fc6R_JHjGFhemhA_A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpvXL-Fc6R_JHjGFhemhA_A	1	Uggy_KkHHRRocXgCoAEC	nay rod

Thank you for exposing your bigotry; you are right about ignorance is directly coming from fear and unknown since how you wrong your irreverent comments. By the way, majority of Mexican's ancestors are mainly responsible for killing & raping Indians, stealing theirs land from west side of US to down south of Central America, including Cuba, Mexico, and all other island since you all are started from Spain. Also, Mexicans and all other Hispanics had enslaved the Black, Indians, and all other races down in Mexico before they killed them all when they don't need them; same happens in Cuba, Puerto Rico, Brazil, etc... Anyone who got butthurts and disagreed with it can go ahead and denied that by calming "No! Mexican would NEVER do that! We are HARD WORKERS! WE ARE BEAOTJTOJAO1 YEAH! JAJAJAJA" or whatever the hell you guys talk in these day, but...... remember this: Knowledge and reality are the most important than pretending the other way, including resource the BS information from website and news, like you all Mexican, minorities and white trash kept using to avoid getting your feeling hurts.

Some people can't afford trips towards out country and they don't have the resources to learn English. While yes I do believe that the system is flawed just plain kicking out illegal immigrants is wrong and can both tear families apart and can happen by miss identification. Just like our normal court system people get falsely accused so radical ideas such as immigration bans and mass deportations are the truly morally wrong thing here. Also do recon that the "they steal our jobs" mindset is incredibly misleading. A good way to see how immigrant families, in this case legal ones please watch the movie McFarland, USA it shows some good examples of actual positions immigrants have to take with little to no other choice. Instead of taking a perspective against legal immigration and stopping it America should be supporting programs like DACA which if properly extended to all illegal immigrants would get them identified and allow them to properly assess builds and legally own property allowing them to become normal members of society. Again don't think of illegal immigrants as immoral people stealing your jobs think more on the lines of people who need a better life and don't have the resources to acquire it legally.

Before I'm called a racist hear me out. To many of these "white racists" it has nothing to do with race or "purity", it's about rule of law. Most laws exist to keep people safe. A legal system protects Americans (white, black, Hispanic, etc) from possible terrorists who would harm them. I don't care what race an immigrant is, all that matters is that they follow our laws when in the country.

UggthVJkriOoCngCoAEC.8V8ubDlAT5_8YdPAEFKa5V		1	2017-10-13 03:45:36	Sketching Perfection	M A L Day There weren‚Äôt laws on immigration because the America‚Äôs were largely unexplored. When the first colony was erected on Ranoake island (prior to the pilgrim colony @ Plymouth Rock) the Americas were a mystery to colonizers. The Spanish and the Europeans had an equal interest in the un-surveyed land in America and they both laid claim to areas of land. While the first settlers were European pilgrims, Spanish conquistadors soon followed and they mistreated native populations by implementing the encomienda system, which illustrates that ALL settlers mistreated the native populations. Furthermore, the Europeans were preceded by the Vikings and the Templar knights before them in the discovery of America, so the Europeans were not ‚Äútechnically‚Äù the first colonizers of the Americas. Even if they had been, the original colonizers (pilgrims) traveled to America for religious freedom and did not attempt to ‚Äúpillage‚Äù from the natives (unless you include land to build houses on). The pilgrims eventually allied with Squanto and the local tribes of Amerindians for survival, so America was founded on religious freedom and unity, not pillaging.üá∫üá∏	UCcJh4ag9TUYAtZyvFJut1Mw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcJh4ag9TUYAtZyvFJut1Mw	1	UggthVJkriOoCngCoAEC	M A L Day

Then the employer doesnt have to pay taxes on them plus benefits like healthcare. Plus they will work for peanut but since they dont pay taxes in any form. So they actually make more than americans. And if they do pay taxes immagrants can claim up to as many dependents as possible with out proof. Thats directly from the irs word for word. So they dont actually pay any taxes plus get more money back. Thats not even including the dual id crap they pull with a different id and another visa to get free social services. Also i used to work with Hispanics kept up with them, and surpased them. plus did more jobs that most of them combined. Try 8 mini jobs that were separate jobs of 8 people. All done by one white guy. Plus picthed in with heavier crap that they couldn't do. Ive done shite that immagrants wouldn't do. And got payed of their typical check of $1,200.00 a week no taxes taken out only $350.00 to $380.00 at most. So don't give this bs they work harder for less or "they get the jerb done". Plus heres the kicker i work 3 jobs a week 7 days a week. I maybe get 6 hours of sleep every fourth or sixth day of the week. With no time off in 9yrs. Having to pick up everyone elses slack.

They hold incredibly dangerous, underpaid jobs without the possibility of calling for help from the government so their employers honour their rights as workers. Mind you, some states have already tried 'getting though on illegal immigrant employers' so they have to employ US citizens. Few showed. Even less finished the fruit picking season. Because the brutal strain and dangerous conditions aren't worth even the legal amount of compensation (with added benefits!) that employers had to legally offer.... which is of course far better than what immigrants get. Often the dire situations they're fleeing are at least partially the result of US imperialism.

Im an illegal immigrant, someone who cheated the system to come here not for the betterment of this nation and to become one but to be a selfish asshole who feels entitled to free everything. Me this illegal is not registered, and can be paid below the minimum wage, Cheaper labor for company, company fires actual citizens of said country, hires illegals.

It's not that immigrants are proper badass & macho for accepting shitty conditions, and local kids are too 'uppity' and 'pussies' to take them. It's that the conditions are objectively unjust, exploitative and unsustainable, and immigrants are the most vulnerable and easy to exploit group of the two because they can't report abuse, can't afford to spend more time looking for a halfway decent job on govt aid, etc. These are shitty things that they *suffer* through and that we should aspire to *end* the need for. Not setting an example of the right way to do things for 'pussy' millenials that in some cases do stand up for being treated as humans by employees. Which is *good*. It's how every protection for workers so far was achieved. I've only ever really seen the 'coddled millenial' thing in rich kids anyway. And those have always been that way. Other kids might be a little out of touch.. because they're the first generation in living memory to, through no fault of their own, do worse economically than their parents. So sure, some are middle class kids trying to get used to life in the working class. But that indicates that, if anything, it's previous generations that were coddled by an unsustainable system that had them live an unsustainable lifestyle only to crash down on later generations' heads.

Nobody wants to hire the overly coddled, unskilled, socially inept generation that is currently coming into the workforce. I would sooner higher a convict or someone on a work visa before I would hire some uppity fucking millennial that starts crying 1 hour into an 8 hour shift or gets "sick" three times a week.

Your employers would be not only greedy but operating within and trying to turn a profit off an extremely broken joke of a capitalist system where these sorts of jobs, when properly compensated with pay and services such as healthcare, render their business unprofitable and ultimately unsustainable- or rather, expose the fact that it already is so. Some states have already tried 'getting tough' on the employment of undocumented immigrants. As a result, businesses had to meet U.S. federal and state regulations for their employees. The jobs in question were harvesting, which is backbreaking labour under the sun. A tiny number of people showed up. Almost none finished the season. The laws had to be rolled back. What mystifies me is how immigrants can still possibly be stereotyped as lazy when the majority of undocumented immigrants take hard, unjust jobs which the documented population who can afford to keep looking (and apply for government assistance in the meantime) rightfully refuse. It's not that the documented population are lazy, it's that they know those jobs are a shitty deal. The way some of them turn around and direct their fury at those desperate enough to take the jobs regardless of the injustice instead of at the unjust system is truly a tragedy.

They both came for a better life thats all they wanted, but we live in northeastern wisconsin where everyone is white and when I&#39;m with my parents out in public people strait up stare. And when i speak spanish to my mom or albanian to my dad people don&#39;t give stares in interest...they give stares of hate. Kids at my school used to occasionally tease me about being a terrorist since my dads from a muslim country even though we don&#39;t practice the religion. And the same kids would sometimes tease me about being half latina because immediately they probably thought of mexico even though I&#39;m not even mexican. My parents work so hard and when i should this to MY dad who&#39;s a serious, skeptical, impatient, sometimes rude man nearly cried I&#39;m not even kidding and I&#39;ve never seen him anywhere close to crying.

With Graduation he created a new era of more techno beats and less samples from the 70s. With the College Dropout he made hip hop more about the hustle in general and not just about the hustle in the hood. He's a legend for better or for worse.

They traveled illegally over here (but they later became legal I think), and my great-grandpa would hide with his family in some farmers barn and ask for the throw-away part of the skimmed milk the farmer had. Just that made me sympathize with illegals, but regardless, they still are illegal.<br />Mexico needs to get their shit together.

And this country wasn't built on immigrants, this country wasn't even a country until we broke away from England, (allowing us to create our own laws, and create our borders, and start illegegating immigration without legal documentation) The reason we're here is because England wanted to become bigger and expand thier country. So thank England for wanted to control the world because without that, you'll be sitting in a different seat right now, literally.

The problem lies with Islam. The quran and deluded followers of islam claim that this ‚Äúreligion‚Äù spread due to the followers of Muhammad traveling the east and spreading the word, acquiring new converts as they went by performing miracles, trading goods etc. This is a very fanciful story, and one which is NOT corroborated by actual historical events. The truth paints a very different picture and we are taken back to the Ancient Pagan Tribes and Civilizations of Arabia and the Middle East, who were brutally attacked and besieged for centuries by violent psychotic bandits who were the true founders of what we now know as islam. These attacks left trails of blood across the globe and ended in the destruction of Ancient Gentile culture and the enslavement of our People which is still effective to this day.

I understand being ashamed because while some of my family has been here long enough to have fought in the Revolutionary War, my family from Georgia owned slaves and had children with them. My uncle found those descendants on Ancestry.com but couldn't bring himself to contact them because of the awkward and sensitive nature of how we're related. My family started making up for it - Alice Walker who brought The Color Purple was born on my family land (that we still own) in Georgia, and my great-aunt would drive her and her siblings to school to make sure they got an education because the house and land is still in the boonies. And yet when I met my Georgia family for the first time in 2015, including my dad's cousins who KNEW and PLAYED with Alice, were racist as fuck blaming the blacks the next county over for the rise in crime and FOX News was always on. The other reason I'm ashamed is because of other white people - the only people who've been racist to me? Other fucking white people. They're the only ones who have said horrendous things to me because of my Jewish blood even though my family stopped practicing after my great-granddad's death as he married a Catholic and had the kids raised Catholic. Doesn't matter to them - they tell me I'm a freak, dirty, and to prepare for a REAL Holocaust. I know every race can be racist, but here in America, most of the racist dicks I come across are white. And conservative. And Christian. Hell, I had a Christian tell me I should be put to death because I'm atheist and somehow responsible for the deaths of Christians and Muslims.

But that was in the past. The people who come over illegally now may need some but to me it seems like they are doing just fine on their own working hard for the same chances every one of us in America is born with so what I assume that when they crossed they didn't expect us to take care of them i saw the comment you made after that still doesn't make it better.

I said that some the immigrants have good intentions and if I didn't well not all immigrants are rapists and drug dealers, but that does not mean they can just waltz over the boarder. And we can't just excuse those who couldn't afford to come over legally. What would be the point of having citizenship or closed boarders if you can just come over because you want to and you don't have enough legally? Yes we should try to help those in need, but we aren't able to help everyone.

The reason know how much it takes to come here legally puts one into the perspective, cause if you ever did look it up would you have that kind of American dollar bills lying around? And where did the rapist comment even come from? It is unrelated to your previous comment ,the original comment i said anything on you cant just single everything into one side or another sadly in this world there are shades do you assume illegal immigrants are all drug dealers or rapists or is that the only thing you think of when you hear illegal immigrant ;because yeah there are a cruel fact of the world but there are also people who are trying to make better lives for their families or themselves. Or they are trying to get away from situations like in Sweden. i believe you are ignorant because you care for things superficially and pry will just keep doing that saying things like your first original comment not understanding what your comment could do to another Person not caring. Not that me ranting to you is any better, but I believe if I can get one person to empathize in anyway than cool if i cant hopefully you can grow out of it or find individuals who are likeminded.

Being immigrant just means coming from somewhere else. An American moving to England would be an immigrant, a Californian moving to Florida would technically be an immigrant. It says it in the song "the word immigrant has suddenly become a bad word". There is nothing wrong with the word, it's the way that it has been used. The fight isn't getting people to stop calling others immigrant, the fight is for them to stop seeing "immigrant" as a bad thing	UCQ3PFNRC7KhNNoK8EqAfqwQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQ3PFNRC7KhNNoK8EqAfqwQ	1	Ugitc3Cz2zZcLngCoAEC	Krista, unfortuantely

Blaming the country you immigrated to for your lot in life(&quot;our bombs landed on them like the Mayflower.&quot;) 2. &quot;Buckingham Palace or Capitol Hill, blood of my ancestors had that all built&quot; saying that Pakistanis, rather than whites, built Buckingham Palace or pretending all POC are the same and that the black(West African) slaves who built Capitol Hill were actually Pakistani Muslims. 3. And lastly, praising the SANDINISTAS of all people as a model for immigrant struggle- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_35a7sn6ds&amp;t=4m09s">4:09</a>. I really don&#39;t need to say anything there do I, or is the lack of education in the Anglophone world so bad that people think those guys are and were heroes now? Next &quot;empowering&quot; hip-hop song will praise the Castros no doubt(you can already see this in America where Jay-Z wore a Che Guevara T-shirt unironically a few years back.) <br /><br />Honestly this song would be great if you like cut out some parts of Riz Ahmed&#39;s verse and that last guy&#39;s verse that portrayed militant Sandinistas and violent drug cartels as being morally superior to ICE agents doing their jobs. Why ruin your song with that kind of postcolonial socialist bullcrap?	UCYkskNXTxfVgqYuKhtzyH3w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYkskNXTxfVgqYuKhtzyH3w	0

Some people don&#39;t see that if it wasn&#39;t for the ancestors that got us here we wouldn&#39;t be in the situation whether it&#39;s better or not the fact is that we are all alike in some situations. So trying to prove yourself higher than one person is going to get you nowhere, but that&#39;s exactly what people are doing right now. This video sends great message to people who are listening.

Personally I think there should be a fine if they have not been found guilty of any other crimes and put on the path to citizenship and allowed to work, Misdemeanors result in a fine but they have to wait more time before getting a chance to work. Illegal immigrants who have committed violent crimes should be deported.	UCwZY20X00tLp-nNcCNCbfZA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwZY20X00tLp-nNcCNCbfZA	0

You want Lady Liberty to give you a lap dance? The woman who&#39;s holding the lamp so you can find your way here and you want her to get on her knees for you? I get that maybe you didn&#39;t mean it like that, but it&#39;s what you said. It&#39;s like, the few people who were on the conservative side (and I&#39;m not one) just heard that you DO want to take advantage of <b>kindness</b>.<br />There are words in here about the crimes of the citizens of this nation and the retribution...while using the beat of a musical about a revolution against the people being represented by the Wrong Side in THIS current debate...and what happened to those people? In a way, in our revolution, because our enemy was across the sea, we didn&#39;t see a lot of what happened to the losers...but they did exist. People were hanged. People were tarred and feathered, which you may really want to look into before recommending it as a recourse. People lost everything they&#39;d ever worked for and established...all while being the people of that community who played by the rules and paid their taxes.<br />Stop acting like that didn&#39;t happen and didn&#39;t and doesn&#39;t exist...and that on a very deep level that evades easy conversation, these alarm bells are ringing loud and clear.<br />You get the job done...and for a lot of people who currently live in this country, they hear that the job about to get done is them.<br /><br />THINK about what you&#39;re saying and how other people might hear it instead of calling anybody who objects a racist and shouting them down. They&#39;re doing you a favor. I don&#39;t think the average immigrant really wants to come to the US and bend us all over a chair...but if they&#39;re singing this song, it&#39;ll sound like they do.

In the UK, "Asian" usually means South Asians. In the US, "Asian" usually means East Asians. To avoid confusion, it's better to say East Asian or South Asian.

But showcasing mainly Hispanic/Latino, etc. and Middle Eastern and some Asian immigrants makes sense as it does mirror the overwhelming home countries of the current wave of immigrants coming to America. Irish and Italians mainly came in the 1800s and first half of the 1900s - though mine came here in the 1600 or 1700s and fought in the Revolutionary War as they were fortunate to have enough money to support themselves. And many of the Asians that came a couple hundred years ago were Chinese, Japanese, etc. whereas now more are Hmong, Vietnamese, etc. And while there are still people coming from Africa (mainly voluntarily), it was nothing like the numbers dragged here against their will and owned by assholes, which unfortunately includes another branch of my family from Georgia. It does exclude some, but at least it mirrors the current wave of immigrants that get shit on. I get so furious at the people who commit crimes against Sikhs because they're so stupid they think they're Middle Eastern and Muslim, and the asshole attitudes by many conservatives towards Muslims and Middle Eastern immigrants. I connect with them more even though I'm white as hell because of my family - my gran's family fled Germany only a couple generations before she was born; it was the 1860s and they were threatened with violence constantly because they were wealthy, Jewish, business owners - it's not like it only magically started happening with Hitler. They willingly lost most of their fortune to move here to America to live before strict immigration numbers drove them away, which was what happened to many fleeing the Nazis and ended up dying in the end because they were turned away. I always remind myself how lucky my family was that most of them left Germany in time, and they were able to support themselves and face racism head on - and some even stood up for the Japanese-Americans they knew because they could relate. And so many Muslim immigrants are going through the same things as the Jewish and Japanese-Americans, and I wish more realized that and stood up for them. Some people shit on me for being vocally supportive because they are so deluded into thinking most Muslims are bad, and I started crying when Trump started banning people and some of my liberal friends kind of agreed with him. It damaged some of my friendships and faith in humanity to be honest. And now with Trump trying to fuck over Dreamers. America is getting sooo fucked up over immigrants...

He starred in movies like Star Wars: Rogue One, Nightcrawler, and Four Lions, and in TV shows like Girls and The Night Of, which has got him nominations for Golden Globe and Emmy awards. He makes a few Star Wars references on this track. By the way, Pakistan is in South Asia (same goes for India), not the Middle East... The confusion in America is because of Bush's "Greater Middle East" nonsense, which lumped Pakistan together with the Middle East.

I&#39;m not a USA&#39;s citizent, i&#39;m a Argentinean and my grandfathers come from the other side of the ocean to work, they let all behind to work here, no one gift them something, they won all with their work. Those immigrants make our contries great, don&#39;t those who want everything free and doesn&#39;t show a little bit of respect for the country where they live. That&#39;s all.

As the kid of an European immigrant that makes me happy. We are very underrepresented. On my dad&#39;s side: his mom moved to America from Spain and his grandpa moved to America from Germany. Dad was born here but moved to Spain when he was 1 and lived there until 25 when he moved back. On my moms side: my great grandma moved to America from Ireland and my great grandpa from Italy. After two generations of poor families working 70 hour weeks, we finally have a stable life. I&#39;m so proud of my parents, especially my dad. He grew up in the hood in one of the most dangerous cities in the US. All his childhood friends are dead or in jail. And he, he ended becoming a wonderful lieutenant at his cities police station. He has been fighting for police reform for years. One of the cops there shot some black kid for no reason, and my dad got him arrested. I&#39;m so proud of him. People like my dad are going to give police their good name back.	UCjPI8d6Ly9xRFhn5pX8qFyA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjPI8d6Ly9xRFhn5pX8qFyA	0

Immigrants are important to this country, they help build every day life and deserve far more than they are given here in the US. So when somebody shouts how terrible immigrants are remember this poem. Immigrants are looking for a better life here.

We speak the same languages, we come from the same background. How dare you turn your backs on your own brothers. We are Hispanic! In this country we are not labeled by the country we represent, WE ARE LABELED AS HISPANIC/LATINO. Wake up and notice that you&#39;re brother and sister needs help. Stop letting the division get in the way. We are the same. It doesn&#39;t matter to me, if you&#39;re hispanic I will defend you , because we are a voice to reckoned with.

Hearing comments about how &quot;immigrants steal our jobs&quot; or &quot;there are too many immigrants&quot; or even &quot;All they do is sit around and get paid for nothing&quot; Both my grandparents worked two jobs each and my parents both got jobs as soon as they hit high school. Where did that come from that immigrants don&#39;t work hard? Because we worked hard to get here and we continue to work hard to stay here. The country was founded on immigration, yet you wouldn&#39;t say they just sat around?<br /><br />Immigrants, we yet the job done.

First, you can make a general assumption out of ONE person. Second, they don&#39;t steal jobs. They do the jobs that others will never do, perfect example: cleaning bathrooms, cleaning sewers, planting fruits/vegetables under inhumane conditions, etc. All they want is a chance of a better life than they had in their countries.

Ugisc0PCm83iCHgCoAEC.8UluSRx7uUP8WczggGWnCW		2	2017-08-24 06:51:27	BlindTruths	I believe if you immigrate you should do your due to try and become legal and learn the language. So I fall into neither of those. But I respect immigrants who come here and work, as long as they're giving back and contributing as well. We're giving to them, they're giving to us. A country shouldn't just be give/give/give or take/take/take. It should be both give and take. You give us tax, we give you a place to live and freedom. You give us respect, we keep you safe. I'm stating you as a whole, not solely about non-caucasian people. I'm using the terms you and we as in YOU everyone who lives here and WE as government/country. I wouldn't move to Germany or France or Mexico or Russia or China and not bother to learn the language. Sure China might be hard because.. waaaat?! But, I'd learn the language rather than expect everyone there to accommodate to me. I also think if you're say.. German/Italian/Russian/Mexican/Canadian/fucking alligator from Mars and you're a fucking sociopath who has a record of raping children, burning animals on grilles, and running old grannies over with cars, but you got off because you ratted out someone worse - you have NO right to be here.

Period}<br />You know, and it gets into this whole issue of border security, you know, who&#39;s gonna say that the borders are secure? We&#39;ve got the House and the Senate debating this issue, and it&#39;s... it&#39;s really astonishing that in a country founded by Immigrants, &quot;immigrant&quot; has somehow become a bad word. So the debate rages on and we continue....<br /><br />[Intro: &quot;Yorktown&quot; sample]<br />[Hercules Mulligan]<br />And just like that it‚Äôs over, we tend to our wounded, we count our dead<br />[John Laurens]<br />Black and white soldiers alike wonder if this really means freedom‚Ä¶<br />[George Washington]<br />Not yet<br /><br />[Verse 1: K‚ÄôNaan]<br />I got 1 job, 2 job, 3 when I need them<br />I got 5 roommates in this one studio, but I never really see them<br />And we all come to America trying to get a lap dance from Lady Freedom<br />But now Lady Liberty is acting like Hillary Banks with a pre-nup<br />Man I was brave, sailing on graves<br /> Don‚Äôt think I didn‚Äôt notice those tombstones disguised as waves<br />I‚Äôm no dummy, here is something funny, you can be an immigrant<br />without risking your lives<br />Or crossing these borders with thrifty supplies<br />All you got to do is see the world with new eyes<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />Immigrants, we get the job done<br /><br />Look how far I come<br />Look how far I come<br />Look how far I come<br /><br />We get the job done<br /><br />Look how far I come<br />Look how far I come<br />Look how far I come<br /><br />Immigrants, we get the job done<br /><br />[Verse 2: Snow Tha Product]<br />It‚Äôs a hard line when you‚Äôre an import<br />Baby boy, it‚Äôs hard times<br />When you aint send for<br />Racists feed the belly of the beasts<br />With they pitchforks, rich chores<br />Done by the people that get ignored<br />Ya se arm√≥ <br />Ya se despertaron<br />It‚Äôs a whole awakening<br />La alarma ya son√≥ hace rato<br />Los que quieren buscan<br />Pero nos apodan como vagos<br />We are the same ones<br />Hustling on every level<br />Ten los datos<br />Walk a mile in our shoes<br />Abr√≥chense los zapatos<br />I been scoping ya dudes, y‚Äôall ain‚Äôt working been working like I do<br />I‚Äôll outwork you, it hurts you<br />You claim I‚Äôm stealing jobs though<br />Peter Piper claimed he picked them, he just underpaid Pablo<br />But there ain‚Äôt a paper trail when you living in the shadows<br />We‚Äôre America‚Äôs ghost writers, the credit‚Äôs only borrowed<br />It‚Äôs a matter of time before the checks all come<br />But‚Ä¶<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />Immigrants, we get the job done<br /><br />Look how far I come<br />Look how far I come<br />Look how far I come<br /><br />We get the job done<br /><br />Look how far I come<br />Look how far I come<br />Look how far I come<br /><br />Immigrants, we get the job-<br /><br />Not yet<br /><br />[Bridge: Snow Tha Product]<br />The credit is only borrowed<br />It‚Äôs America&#39;s ghost writers, the credit&#39;s only borrow-borrowed<br />It‚Äôs America&#39;s ghost writers<br />America&#39;s ghost writers<br />America&#39;s ghost writers, the credit&#39;s only borrow-borrowed<br />It‚Äôs America‚Äôs ghost writers, a credit is only borrowed<br />It‚Äôs America‚Äôs ghost writers, a credit is only borrowed<br />It‚Äôs America‚Äôs ghost writers, a credit is only borrowed<br />It‚Äôs<br /><br />[Hook]<br />Immigrants, we get the job done<br /><br />[Verse 3: Riz MC]<br />Ay yo aye, immigrants we don‚Äôt like that<br />Na they don‚Äôt play British empire strikes back<br />They beating us like 808‚Äôs and high hats<br />At our own game of invasion, but this ain‚Äôt Iraq<br />Who these fugees what did they do for me<br />But contribute new dreams<br />Taxes and tools, swagger and food to eat<br />Cool they flee war zones, but the problem ain‚Äôt ours<br />Even if our bombs landed on them like the Mayflower<br />Buckingham Palace and Capitol Hill<br />Blood of my ancestors had that all built<br />It‚Äôs the ink you print on your dollar bill, oil you spill<br />Red line on the flag you hoist when you kill<br />But still we say ‚Äúlook how far I come‚Äù<br />Hindustan, Pakistan, to London<br />To a galaxy far from their ignorance<br />Cos-<br /><br />[Hook]<br />Immigrants, we get the job done<br /><br />[Verse 4: Residente]<br />Por tierra o por agua<br />Identidad falsa<br />Brincamos muros o flotamos en balsas<br />La peleamos como Sandino en Nicaragua<br />Somos como las plantas que crecen sin agua<br />Sin pasaporte americano<br />Porque La mitad de Gringolandia Es terreno Mexicano<br />Hay que ser bien hijo e puta<br />Nosotros Les Sembramos el √°rbol y ellos se comen la fruta<br />Somos los que cruzaron<br />Aqu√≠ vinimos a buscar el oro que nos robaron<br />Tenemos mas trucos que la polic√≠a secreta<br />Metimos la casa completa en una maleta<br />Con un pico, una pala<br />Y un rastrillo<br />Te construimos un castillo<br />Como es que dice el coro cabr√≥n?<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />Immigrants, we get the job done<br /><br />Look how far I come<br />Look how far I come<br />Look how far I come<br /><br />We get the job done<br /><br />Look how far I come<br />Look how far I come<br />Look how far I come<br /><br />Immigrants, we get the job done<br /><br />Look how far

The original was suppose to showcase two people that came to colonial America for a better life, and they worked hard for it, literally fought a war for it, and achieved it. Lafayette even went back to his own country and helped fight for freedom there. The point is that the majority of immigrants come here and work hard for a life they wish they had as a child, and give it to their children, no matter skin color or ethnicity.

The foundation that partnered with India to train 150,000 doctors to treat people with HIV/AIDS. How is that stealing? PLUS, she cut all ties with the foundation when she became Secretary of State so that she wouldn't illegally accept money from foreign nations. In addition, you say that you would prefer Bernie, yet you support the Anti-Bernie. Bernie literally hates Trump's guts and proved time and time again why Trump is a horrible candidate in all of his rallies.

Which president said, &quot;we welcome all immigrants and their hard working contributions, but we are a nation of laws and they must respect them.&quot;<br /><br />That&#39;s right Bill the Clinton. Before the democrats tried pandering to the Latino base. <br /><br />The statistics are there, if you want to get out of poverty in this country within a generation, immigrate LEGALLY! My father came here when he was 21 and is the hardest worker I know. Did you also know that immigrant Asians are now the richest demographic in America? They have more wealth than the white class. Next wealthiest is Indians. Know what they all have in common? Yup, you guessed it, they&#39;re all legal. <br /><br />You cannot obtain any amount of wealth here if you don&#39;t start off correctly. The process isn&#39;t as hard as people make it out to be.

My mom has been at this job for almost 11 years now and this guy got promoted in the first WEEK!?! Ugh, I can't. But, my mom is really strong and she lets these go.....at some point in the year.

Europe is a complete disaster plagued by the social experiment fail we call the EU. Europe is bombarded with terror attacks and society is so divided. Spain is actually known as the terror hub, a place where ISIS does most of their recruiting. Europe is too diverse of history, language, and culture to be unified under a European Union. Europe is also going under a refugee crisis, one that is much larger than the USA's. Most of Europe's refugees dont even come from the Middle East, most of them emigrate from places like Somalia or Morocco. Europe as we know it is collapsing under the weight of the economic and social toll of immigration and too much progressiveness. So no, Europe isn't just a "minor mess".

If not, then I would say the west is owned by their respective governments, and not by any "people" of any ethnicity, religion, or even on an individual level. No one person "owns" any land they didn't pay for to own from the government; so that's a pretty stupid thing to say. Being there first doesn't mean a damn thing, otherwise we all have a claim to portions of Africa. Governments own land, maintain and utilize the resources of the land, and protect it, not you or I. What he means by "unable to maintain civilization" is likely in reference to cities of Africa which had a functioning infrastructure, and then once European's left those cities, the infrastructure failed (Starvation in South Africa is an example after the apartheid), which is a claim I disagree with, since European culture/infrastructure is not the only civilization that functions or need be used. And the issue here is not immigrants, they are a lovely economic boost that helps keep GDP high, illegal immigrants as criminals is the issue here, at least in my perspective. My family came over through the legal channels, as did most peoples; anything less is breaking the law, no matter how tear jerking the story behind your family is.

If labor becomes cheaper, prices will drop, which will put more money into the pockets of regular people, which will make them spend and invest more, which will drive new businesses and jobs, potentially for the person whose job could be &quot;stolen&quot; in the first place. So all in all, by taking skilled immigrants from lower class countries, AMERICA is the thief, and we are hurting all the other countries if we are able to cherry pick the good immigrants. Which is why as an American I like limited immigration.	UChU0k7UqQY0RK_9aw6nDq8g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UChU0k7UqQY0RK_9aw6nDq8g	0

Its unclear if you are advocating for that view or if you're just pointing out that that used to be the stereotype (and that it was unfairly a stereotype). If the former, then you clearly missed the whole point of this song.. immigrants are pretty much always grinding. But yes, of course for much of american history we've demonized immigrants.

People forget Latinos and Hispanics are racist to black people as well we making a big deal with the immigrants while we die in the streets all they doing is sending you back where you can from they kill us and get away with it and sadly will keep getting away with it. Again im not saying yall arent going through stuff but let&#39;s not all act like omg this is terrible this has never happened before omg!! When it did happen and 1 million times worse than whats going on now I wish all they did to black people is send them home we get hate from every race and die because of our color not told hey go back where you came from.

As usual, Lin-Manuel Miranda is completely clueless to his own unconscious perpetuation of rape culture. Like rapping about not being able to sexually resist (&quot;can&#39;t say no&quot;) to a woman looking &quot;helpless&quot; with her &quot;legs spread&quot;--an actual line from the musical, Hamilton. So-called &quot;progressive&quot; men of all colors on the left are so. damn. clueless. to their own enabling of the hypermasculinity and rape culture scripts normalized in hip hop.

I think the entire question could be put aside if we simply restructured our taxes to be sales instead of income and loosened gun laws. Then it wouldn&#39;t really matter who we allowed over. If anyone lives here, they are paying taxes and if Anyone misbehaves they get shot.	UCNDMAo5uoirjYHGEh1Yzmwg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNDMAo5uoirjYHGEh1Yzmwg	0		
UgjfxCq9ZTSG33gCoAEC	0	1	2017-07-06 16:07:14	Stefanie Ann	I feel really lucky. My Mom was born here but her parents were immigrants, and now at nearly 70 years old, they have been legal for over 20 years. My mom being the oldest of 5 had to take care of her younger siblings and wasn&#39;t allowed to do any sports or school activities. Why? Because her Mother worked the night shift and her Father was an alcoholic. Her father also made her start working at age 14 and stole most of her small pay check. My Dad was the 3rd of 7 kids. He lived in Mexico until he was 20. His father was turned into an Alcoholic and was kicked out by my dad&#39;s mother. My dad and two of his brothers voluntarily worked for the family. My dad worked at a pizzeria and frequently brought home pizza because the family barely ate anything besides beans and eggs. His older brother was able to provide every child with some sort of Christmas gift. His younger brother walked to work instead of taking the bus to save money. A total of 8 miles. With that money, he would buy the kids shoes. He would always hide his own shoes. One day, they found his shoesm They were old and very worn out and torn apart. At the age of 23, mu dad&#39;s younger brother died from lung cancer. But when my dad was 20, he illegally crossed the border. He moved to were we reside today, Illinois. He lived with a friend in a trashy apartment. He worked one full time, two part time. He frequently sent money back to his family and at age 26 he was able to buy his own house. Then at age of 33, he and my mom married. Since my Mom was born in the USA, he was able to get his application looked at. And he has now been legal for nearly 15 years. While I do agree, not every immigrant is trying to have a better life. A few are just selling drugs. But MOST are here for a better life. Because immigrants are people too. People with hopes and dreams. People with likes and dislikes. People who just want a better life. Not many are as lucky as my family. But if we give them a chance, they could be.

The idea that was he was all for the little guy is compete poppycock and not in the least bit supported by primary sources. It&#39;s pure revisionist history.

Start hustling like mexicans<br />llegals don&#39;t pay taxes? <br />uhhh yes they do, they get taxes off there pay check ever week. Ask my tio(:<br /><br />As American Citizens you are given so many opportunities. The difference is most illegals come from a place where l those opportunities don&#39;t even exist. So they actually take them, unlike people here that see it as normal and take it for granted. <br /><br /><br />You need a good a good paycheck? if your a guy work in construction, Have fun working in the hot sun. If you are a woman go to your local hospital or hotel and work as a cleaning lady. Good luck trying to survive 8 hours a day every day of the week on ether jobs.

You see, there was this era of the planet called the ice age. Landforms moved and allowed Africans to walk across the ocean on ice accumulations. They walked from the continent of Africa to the continent of North America. But if you don&#39;t want to think about how all people evolved from the same people group and want to start dividing us based on citizenship (and really, color... as you want all white Americans except for a small percent that agree with you to seem racist) then go ahead, ignore this.

Try living a life as an immagrent. Try running away from a horrible life and go looking for a better on. The life of an immagrent is HARD. on no but y&#39;all can say shit cuz y&#39;all were born here in America. I was born in America. I AM LUCKY AND SO ARE YOU BUT THAT DOESN&#39;T GIVE YOU THE RIGHT TO TALK SHIT ABOUT PEOPLE WHO WANT A BETTER LIFE FOR THEIR CHILDREN. IT&#39;S FUCKED UP. TRY LIVING A LIFE OF AN IMMAGRENT AND SEE HOW HARD LIGE IS FOR THEM. TAKING CARE OF THEIR CHILDREN, FINDING JOBS. speaking of jobs immagrents get the jobs that you lazy ass Americans don&#39;t want to do. let me list a few that I know: Plantation, construction, Some times working at restaurants, and cleaning your shit. we are not here for drugs or to rape. Now let&#39;s get on the topic of death. Some immagrents DIE to come to America. either they fall off of the trains or get killed by the police. All of this is coming from a 12 year old.

They aren&#39;t stealing your jobs, you&#39;re just too lazy to get one.

I love how quickly you jump to racism and accuse people of just being too lazy to get a job and then tell us how immigrants are taking the jobs that nobody wants. Do you know what happens to a job that nobody wants....employers are forced to pay more to get people interested in doing that job. Many immigrants have to go on government assistance while they learn the skills to make a living, and after the become citizens many of them go back on welfare when they no longer need a job to stay in the country, and they have lots of children and some have more then one wife.....and the government pays for everything, they live off the fucking system. But yeah, the real problem is that people are racist....it's not that they are tired of people parasiting off the government while they work for a living.

While I don&#39;t agree with some of the methods to secure our country, we can just let people wander in freely. Some, SOME, not all, will bring in drugs, and some have evil intentions. We have enough shitty people in this country already, we need to make sure we don&#39;t turn a blind eye to any more coming in. Also: I definitely respect immigrants who work their ass off to make a living. But their is a problem.

We put those labels on each other! There are no such things a race based on our DNA, we are not defined by our color of skin! That is simply a bunch of codes that make a small part of us. Goodness, people must learn the difference between ethnicities, and race. Ethnicity plays a part in your life yes, but being black, white, or whatever doesn&#39;t! We shouldn&#39;t be defined by colors, because we are not simply just one thing. We are made up millions of cells, made my thousands of DNA! Why define of by a color, when you could talk to us, and learn our backstory and see for yourself who we are as people. If a persons a dick, then they&#39;re a dick to you. <br />If a person is nice, then be friends with them. <br />Don&#39;t judge all people based off of a bad encounter with a caucasian/European person or someone who is from South America, the Caribbean, Africa, Asia, and Oceania, or even mixed! <br />I hope someone out there reads this to get some information. I hope this wasn&#39;t too confusing. But in the end of the day, we humans/Homo sapiens make labels for each other which has already backfired and ruined lives for centuries.

So many heartless people demean these poor people, sometimes wishing harm upon them. All they want to do is escape war or leave their country to find a better life for their family and/or children, and often end up being looked down on, refused jobs and rights. On top of that, some people could care less if their entire cultures are destroyed in the most inhumane, bloody ways possible. It is terrible how inhuman some people can be; thoughts like that drove some of the most harsh and cruel people in history. Those of you who contradict proven facts, thinking immigrants are lazy and destroying America, keep in mind that you are most likely descended from them. I don&#39;t believe you don&#39;t have a drop of immigrant blood in your body. It&#39;s just unrealistic, like most of your evidence. I am trying not to curse or be harsh, and keep this family friendly, but you need to realize that these hardworking, unappreciated people are people all the same, just like you. It is no joke what these harmless beings are going through. Sorry for the long comment, but I feel like such an important issue as this is important enough for such a long explaination.

Hispanics, Nigerians, and Middle Easterners. Maybe one out of every 15 applicants is someone with no discernible accent. Most of the Americans who apply actually cringe when they&#39;re told house keeping is available even before they hear what it might pay.

Like if I remember, Africans and Asians (but now In this century, native Americans ) were the first people to roam these countries. Then white and Hispanics started exploring. Technically it would make them illegal immigrants. Even though there weren&#39;t laws, its immigration. Natives owned the land already. Just because they were far behind from the others, doesn&#39;t mean they didn&#39;t own it. If they didn&#39;t, the French and Indian war wouldn&#39;t have happened. And for those of you who are ignorant and can&#39;t read a history book, the war was started because white people started pushing the natives off their land and started invading, causing war and conflict between native tribes and French people. The revolutionary war following after because Americans were too lazy to pay up for their damage. But anyways back to the topic. None of these countries are ours. And you can&#39;t own land. You can&#39;t create land (yes people are making man made lands but I mean real land) land can&#39;t be owned because it doesn&#39;t belong to any of us. I understand there&#39;s terrorist attacks and all, but most of these crimes are committed by citizens. Not illegal immigrants. Immigration isn&#39;t causing anything. You guys are complaining they&#39;re stealing jobs when really you&#39;re the lazy ones. If you weren&#39;t you would&#39;ve had a job already. Maybe if you went to college you would&#39;ve gotten a high value job. I mean, if we look at the news, where have we seen a crime that had been committed by illegal immigrants? I don&#39;t see any. We&#39;re just so used to giving people labels and going by stereotypes to the point where we forgot they are also humans. I come from a family that illegally immigrated here. But now they&#39;re citizens and I am too. Sure it may cause more of a population but isn&#39;t that what countries want? To be more popular? It didn&#39;t matter when you white people invaded and killed people for land but now that others are coming illegally for a better life it&#39;s all wrong just because it&#39;s happening now.

We might all take a deep breath and just consider that our species has &quot;immigrated&quot; from its origins in Africa and then spread all over the world chasing prey and crops, and we&#39;ve always clashed with outsiders in some form or another either because of tribal, territorial, nationalistic, imperialistic, religious beliefs in some form or other. Maybe we can stop screaming at each other because an alien group or other is moving in and realize our cultures and identities continue to evolve along with our basic genetic make-up and we are either going to destroy one another or take the next step, which is to become an intergalactic species. I&#39;d prefer to immigrate to space personally. Maybe the creatures up there will have something to say about that, but at this rate, we&#39;re headed out there and we&#39;d better stock up with knowledge and wisdom to survive in the multiple galaxies out there and stop pretending we&#39;re different from each other.

Irish-Americans who hate the brown immigrants? How quickly you forget how your grandparents were treated here. Jewish, Russian, Italian, Catholics - all hated when they came during the great migration of the 19th century. Only difference is that the white skin stayed after the accent was lost. The thing is - Americans are the mutts of the world, and mutts are always stronger. Immigrants grew this country; they will continue to strengthen this country.

But if you profess Christianity Christ says that all laws are fulfilled in 2 principles which is to love God and love your neighbor as yourself.

Well in a public comment section in which you can scroll up and down I am pretty sure I should be able to see what she sees. My point in the comment was to highlight the blatant over exaggeration to paint a one sided picture in favor of victimizing the original commenter. Also, if you wish to know why it was my business to respond, I'm going to be honest. It was not. I chose to respond because I was tired of seeing people victimize themselves to these unseen ghosts that are "hating" on them.

I was lucky, my parents came here because my dad already had a job in computer science and they transferred him. But not every immigrant is so lucky and I have mad respect for those who stay and are polite because they think that politeness in the face of all this hatred is the price they have to pay, even though it&#39;s not because hopefully one day everyone else will realize that immigrants do everything for us. They started this country and they keep it running today and this song is amazing.	UCMmLpAhpK4GMp_FLaXUrBXg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMmLpAhpK4GMp_FLaXUrBXg	0

These fucks take our jobs (keep in mind it can put someone in the same situation that immigrants are in, broke as fuck and homeless, yet the jobless one is the one who is legally allowed in the country), and people bitch about when they are deported..fuck off mate. How about you say something about the fucking homeless person he made because he was replaced by a fucking illegal who was hired because he would be payed less.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Fucking idiot anti-trump fucks can&#39;t understand deeper level thinking. Don&#39;t just think about what happens to an illegal when they are caught, think about what happens to our people and our country when they aren&#39;t caught.

All countries don&#39;t just let people in without a fee or papers INCLUDING Mexico. If things were to happen in the US and we had to leave, Mexico and other countries wouldn&#39;t have an open door policy. Instead of getting in here illegally and living in fear of being deported just get shit done and come here legally. I have friends who are, might I add, from Mexico and they even agree that people shouldn&#39;t get in illegally. It doesn&#39;t matter what condition they&#39;re in it&#39;s just not an excuse to come here. I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m sure i&#39;m going to get backlash for this comment, but I just had to say something.	UCZ_pWswX3EKx2WiV0rjYSdQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZ_pWswX3EKx2WiV0rjYSdQ	0

However now it is different. There is a centralized government and laws. We need people who come in this country to be documented. I don&#39;t care who comes in my country as long as they are properly documented and safe for everyone here. Let the Mexicans in, and let them be documented, and even help them. It&#39;s called hospitality. They just want a better life. That&#39;s why this country founded. It&#39;s not an exclusive club for the first white who came from Europe. It&#39;s for everyone. Whites, browns, blacks, I don&#39;t give a damn. Muslims, Jews, I don&#39;t care either. They are people too and just because they have a so called &quot;violent religion&quot; or &quot;tainted&quot; views and customs doesn&#39;t mean they can&#39;t be in our country. If your a human should be able to do what you want as long as it doesn&#39;t put other at risk. You people who don&#39;t want the muslims in our country are practically neo Nazis. Yes I&#39;m 14. And yes my opinion is just as valuable as yours.	UCeet4G7DFl4LrjvFG5PfhkQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeet4G7DFl4LrjvFG5PfhkQ	0		
UghZ24RbS56_w3gCoAEC	0	0	2017-07-04 07:47:10	tay doc	Alright, after reading the comments I&#39;m realizing just how twisted this immigration debate is. (Please read the following in a calm, gentle voice as it was intended)<br />FIRST, our country began with white men coming in and taking over but at the time that wasn&#39;t immigration and it certainly wasn&#39;t illegal, you have to remember that was normal for the time. Just like treating the Native Americans so cruelly; it isn&#39;t moral by today&#39;s standards but at the time most people didn&#39;t give it a second thought.<br />TWEEDE, people who don&#39;t support open borders or illegals are not saying immigration is bad. I understand that many of the people who sneak into the country illegally are only looking for a better life but you can&#39;t deny the existence of those who have other, worse plans. Believe it or not, there are evil people out there who will take advantage of open borders. So, while I&#39;m not opposed to immigrants and taking in refugees, I&#39;m also not opposed to taking the time for background checks and being sure these people can be trusted, and I hope many will also agree with that, after all, these could be people that we and our children are brushing shoulders with everyday.<br />TERCERO, the job issue isn&#39;t about immigrants and refugees stealing jobs, it&#39;s about ILLEGALS stealing our jobs. People who come in with no ties to America and start a life. Once again, I understand their country is probably terrible to them and they want to start over, but there are legal ways to do that which involve pulling their own weight and helping the country that they want to live in, no matter if that means waiting longer and working harder. America won the revolution because everyone that wanted it was willing to help in any way possible. We can&#39;t forget that. <br />This only shows the facts I&#39;m aware of, I&#39;m sure I&#39;m missing some and I&#39;m not opposed to being corrected but this is my view point based on the little I know of the subject and debates. I didn&#39;t mean to offend and I wasn&#39;t targeting it against anyone when I wrote it. My only intention was to show things in a much calmer light than some other comments that don&#39;t quite explain it right or seem to know everything going on	UCTos2TxT2p0OfhzmQFmn-4g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTos2TxT2p0OfhzmQFmn-4g	0

Racist shithives of white people acting like their race has always been some kind of paragon of virtue clearly blind themselves to all the shit their ancestors and THEY TOO put people through all around the globe. Frankly speaking, a &quot;dissenting opinion&quot; should never fucking matter as much as someone being allowed to live and provide for their family without having to be terrified of ICE officials or just idiot xenophobes completely destroying their lives. And as for all the idiots in Europe talking about how awful Immigrants are being in your countries, keep in mind who your countries exploited for wealth since the rape of Africa and the birth of colonialism. Nobody but you seems to forget how much evil you do.	UCzStn9s1kEav1IirAr_lWqQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzStn9s1kEav1IirAr_lWqQ	0

UgjPl7FmuFXYc3gCoAEC	0	4	2017-07-04 05:11:25	Gandalf Dumbledore	This comment section bothers me, not that anyone cares. Go ahead, argue with me about my opinion in the sea of other opinions. But first, think. Number one, all of you politicians, this is from the Hamilton mixtape. This means that the races aren&#39;t accurate for the past, but for what races they could be today. Number two, we are stereotyping all immigrants here, in two ways. First, the HAMILTON QUOTE, &quot;immigrants, we get the job done.&quot; Second, saying that all immigrants are rapists, murderers, or other types of horrible people. Neither of these are true for all immigrants, and it would be great if we could accept this. Number three, yes, this country was founded by immigrants, people who were fleeing persecution in their home country, and we took it from the Native Americans. This doesn&#39;t change the fact that the people who created this country as a separate nation were immigrants. White immigrants, but still immigrants or their descendants. Number four, nothing that is happening in this country is the fault of one group. Immigrants, Democrats, Republicans, women, men, liberals, conservatives, we all contribute to every problem Earth is having. Actually, there is one group to blame. Humans. Wherever we come from, however we identify, we all have opinions and all do things on Earth, so we all cause problems. Including me. Including you. Number four, we shouldn&#39;t exterminate a group. That is amoral and unjust. No matter where they come from, they have the potential to be good, hard-working people. This doesn&#39;t justify illegal immigration, but it also means that there should be some way to give them a chance. Number five, immigrants and their relatives and friends, we know that there are hardships where you come from and on your way here, but the people against immigration have points too. Illegal immigration is not the best way to go, if you can help it. But I applaud your bravery. Not all of you are what they make you out to be. Number six, to anti-immigration people, they can&#39;t just &quot;fix their country.&quot; It isn&#39;t a democracy. It is a dangerous, gang-led place. We should perhaps try and help them rather than trapping them where they are unsafe and helpless. <br /><br />There are many things I want to say, but mostly, I just want people to not openly fight and hate each other without educating themselves on the opposing side. We all want to blindly say we are right, but it just causes more conflict if you say uneducated things. I have my opinion, you can have yours, just know that we all have good points and it won&#39;t do just to slam the same ones at each other without trying to actually resolve the conflict.<br /><br />Now, if you still want to, say all of the things that I am wrong about or that you are offended by or disagree with. Because I&#39;m just a voice on the internet. But I want to hear your voice. Educate me.	UC5Jy9Ucs7CNV7Csx5U8Ifpw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5Jy9Ucs7CNV7Csx5U8Ifpw	0

You seem perfectly happy to let every other household own an AK47, but not people who just want a better life.

Immigrants today don't do anything bad, but they are treated like some lesser being. They have to fight comments n them that they are lazy and don't do anything, while working twice as hard as everyone else. They shouldn't be blamed for what other people did, because people should be past that; They should realize that immigrants are people, and we are al the same. Plus, immigrants are working way harder than everyone, for what? A tiny apartment that they can barely afford? If a normal person worked as hard as an immigrant, they might be a millionaire. Immigrants don't get that type of money, because of rich people like Donald Trump who hate immigrants and say that they are lazy slobs who don't do anything	UCa8blHM4zBCU4HnSRlUd2Xg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa8blHM4zBCU4HnSRlUd2Xg	1	UghtC889mLwJJHgCoAEC	sofia moreira

Illegals aren&#39;t special. They don&#39;t deserve to waltz in. Now I&#39;m not going to harass these people, and deporting every single one would destroy out economy.

Without her, my grandmother would never have been born. Without my grandmother, my father would never have been born. Without my father, my brother and I would never have been born. Immigrants create the country. Immigrants, they formed the America and world we have today. We the People formed America. The constitution was written by Alexander Hamilton and many other Americans. Hamilton was a immigrant. This history track was created by an immigrant. Catch my drift? Without immigrants, we wouldn&#39;t have the America we have today.

Immigration is becoming an issue mainly because there's too many people and not enough resources but that does not make an excuse for them to be treated like shit, like they're the only reason our economy is crumbling. They came here for a reason and all most of them have done is their jobs and helped their loved ones. We should be finding a way to make it beneficial for everyone.

Immigration rates are increasing and there is a limit. Obviously immigrants just want the best for themselves and their families, but that doesn't change the fact that immigration is becoming more of an issue, especially when it is illegal. Jobs and resources are finite, no country has the possibility of receiving everybody.

Since you can't pay taxes as an illegal immigrant, it means you arnt contributing to the public services of the country but you use them. It also means you wouldn't be able to actually hold a job other then something where your payed below minimum wage and your payed under the table, since you can't legally work anywhere so employers will take advantage and pay you less than minim.

Many immigrants came for a better life from their war-torn countries, they didnt come to wreck havoc on America. If America was suddenly bombed, you guys would want to go live in another country. Americans have the privilege of having passports, but if they didnt, then you would have to immigrate illegaly. The illegal immigrants came to the U.S as a last traw. They dont want to leave behind their family, they dont want to leave behind their homeland, but they have to, to be able to survive. Immigrating leagaly is very hard to do, it takes time and money, and these guys dont have either, so they make do, and leave, as the song says &quot;metimos toda la casa en una maleta&quot; (We fit the whole house in 1 suitcase). Also, Immigrants commit less crimes than Americans, some immigrants pay taxes and donate money, and many immigrants are the smartest kid in their school. Immigrants created this country, and continue to shape it. If only everyone paid attention.....	UCO3SVSwkuni87zF-Qc5BSKQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO3SVSwkuni87zF-Qc5BSKQ	0

Did you see their reaction to the NPR tweet?? when they quoted the declaration of independence on 4th of july?? All the Trump supporters started crying failing to realize it was the declaration of independence that was being quoted. üòÇüòÇ I'm an immigrant (now a US citizen) I knew exactly what they were quoting. I honestly see myself as more of a true American than a lot of these conservatives. They always claim that my frustration towards Trump is me claiming that I hate my country. Fuck that! I fucking love my country and I fucking love my neighbors who share this land with me regardless of where they come from. People claim Immigrants are destroying this country when in reality it's hatred towards your own neighbor that is destroying this country. Remember that when the government turns its back on us, its your neighbor that will have your back. Its your neighbor that will fight by your side.

Immigration is a cornerstone of this country, and I do believe that the process should be much easier than it is. These people shouldn't have to resort to illegal activity to enter America. That doesn't mean that I think illegal immigration is the right solution, but that doesn't mean I see them as inferior people. Generalizations and insults across party lines are what lead to extreme opinions on both sides. If you want a solution work with each other.

Most people who were born in privileged countries take things for granted and don&#39;t appreciate what they have when there are millions of people just trying to make a better life for themselves. They risk their lives to come to the US or Europe and all we can do is send them back. Yes, there should be some sort of documentation or screening. That i do agree on. But most of these people? They&#39;re no different from you and me. They just want the same opportunities and a better quality of life for them and their families.

Your skin color should not be the thing that defines you or something that places you in a certain group. Everyone either has ancestors that were immigrants or are immigrants. We act as if we own the land, when in fact it is not true, it is used to survive and and live from its resources. Race is what seperates us from reality and the real objective of life. We are to live together in peace. <br /><br />Oh and to you ignorant racist white folks out there, you are no better than any other race, the US would not be what it is today with out the labor of those forced into it and those who are taken advantage of because of what a little piece of paper says. Immigrants are the foundation of things that are great. Everyone is great in their own way and yall need to stop putting others down to make yourself feel better. Y&#39;all so called &quot;adults&quot; should be ashamed of yourselves. All the hatred between y&#39;all is what&#39;s going to be the downfall of everything that is good.

Think about every country, city, state, nation was founded by someone else. We all come from somewhere else making us all immigrants. We all are not just one nationality. So what others take other people&#39;s jobs? Others do the same around the world. America is the HOME OF IMMIGRANTS. How else does everyone think we were founded? America was made up of the European, Asian, etc... hell even the people who already lived on nation grounds Native Americans made up America. Take away all of these what do you have left huh? Ain&#39;t nobody left. Immigrants make up America. Society need to understand this. Are we a nation of states? What&#39;s the state of our nation? To tell the truth we aren&#39;t America anymore. People came here to be free but all I see is a country who enslaves everyone through judgement. I guess all those who went through vengeance and death will always die in vain if this society can&#39;t get past judgement. War made this country, but war will end it. Countries end up ending themselves due to in country wars. Americans say we are the greatest nation of this time and the land of freedom. Yeah I wonder how long we&#39;ll keep living that lie.

What you&#39;d expect, &#39;White&#39; people saying bad things about another race, but occasionally it&#39;s the other way around. A &#39;White&#39; person will say something and everyone will bash on them saying that are are privileged and things like that. But it&#39;s not always true.<br /><br />My parents got divorced when I was 12, it was heartbreaking. My mom had to move to an apartment where the landlord steals money from us every chance he gets. My mom recently applied for a new job just so we could qualify for food stamps and she might get benefits from working for the government. She&#39;s gone broke recently. My dad is always yelling at him to pay her. My mom once dropped her credit card in a parking lot, and someone used it. She couldn&#39;t cancel it or get a new one because the banks were closed. We still live in the apartment. Sometimes we don&#39;t eat dinner, breakfast, or lunch so we can save money. My dad doesn&#39;t know about this, and might not even care. We get called Atheist pieces of crap, even though we are agnostic. Once this guy called me a terrible person and that I will die a slow and terrible death because I&#39;m agnostic and claimed I was atheist. <br /><br />I am a white 13 year old girl. And would normally get yelled at that I don&#39;t know the struggles when saying something.	UC1FI2ZE2YB6tmtsAQWihTqw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1FI2ZE2YB6tmtsAQWihTqw	0

Keep in mind he is Hispanic and he knows Spanish and English, yet never bothered to teach me Spanish. He said &quot;Ya know, when people ask me &quot;Why didn&#39;t you teach your daughter Spanish?&quot; it bothers me, ya know why?&quot; I asked him why, and he said &quot;Because if the people here in America find out you&#39;re half Hispanic, they&#39;ll put you in a job like mine&#39;s.&quot; My dad came here illegally. And he barely get paid enough to live in an apartment. People have said that there&#39;s no reason for my dad to come here. And then I say my dad ran away from being forced to fight in a war. Then they say he&#39;s a pussy because he didn&#39;t fight for his country, that&#39;s when I say it was a civil war. He didn&#39;t want to fight his own people. That&#39;s how much pride he had for his country. Then he started a family in America. He&#39;s a cook, that barely fucking pays, yet he&#39;s the only one in the kitchen the actually does the fucking work. He&#39;s gotten stopped by the police because he&#39;s Hispanic. And because of that, he doesn&#39;t want me to learn Spanish. This is to fucking stupid. I can&#39;t learn a fucking language because it might effect what job I&#39;ll be offered? I&#39;m planning to be an animator.<br />And if I was an immigrant, I might have been fighting to be an animator. But Immigrants do get job done.

Uggo9V4C8NEVxHgCoAEC.8UXYQdu3yI58WWmxeajbDX		2	2017-08-21 11:45:29	Real Cheesy	Wanna hear my story? I'm a white guy who grew up in a area where the majority of people living there is Mexican. Growing up it was Mexicans who were considered cool kids regardless if you were rich or poor and white kids were considered nerds/losers unless you were rich. Growing up in a 99% Mexican neighborhood I would be made fun of because again I'm white. I would be called Gringo cracker and other slurs not in English. People would threaten to beat me up just because i'm white. Finally old enough to get a job I would apply to all the fast food places and stores close to my neighborhood. The store managers all Mexican. All the Employees would be Mexican. I couldn't get a job because I couldn't speak Spanish. About half the customers that come in don't speak English so it's a BIG plus if you can speak Spanish. and with 90% of people applying meeting that requirement I never got a job. I actually ended up borrowing my uncles lawn mower and going door to door asking if they needed there yard cut or any other yard work done. Which was difficult because again a quarter of the people in my neighborhood didn't speak English. Also a difficult job during summer time; pushing a lawn mower in 110+ heat. Kinda funny since its stereotypical of Mexicans to do Yard work/landscaping but since me a white guy couldn't get a job i was doing it. It's funny you cant learn a language cause it would effect what job you would be offered while I couldn't get a job for not being able to speak a certain language. Weird the differences that we grow up with.	UCrz4ee2SHWUnilqCPRCtyAQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrz4ee2SHWUnilqCPRCtyAQ	1	Uggo9V4C8NEVxHgCoAEC	MannyTrashCan

Racism is everywhere and of course it hurts and can put a break on job and real life opportunities but I'm gonna assume you're legal resident of the U.S. and had you learned Spanish it would've given you a greater advantage being bilingual among your peers or coworkers who only know one language. And I know some people might get angry with what I'm trying to say, that maybe I have no idea what it's like, but my parents came into the U.S. illegally, I came to the U.S. Illegally. I already have that major disadvantage on my back and it has forced me to fight 10x harder in order to receive the same treatment as people who are legal U.S. Citizens and might not work as hard as me but my ability to speak both Spanish and English has actually made me stand out and has opened up doors to better opportunities.

Illegal immigrants are considered a tiny minority compared to US born citizens. I'm very grateful to be privileged enough to be born into America, but there are still rules everyone, even foreigners, must obey in America. If an illegal could break the law by crossing the border, what makes it any different if a citizen breaks the law? I understand there is a struggle in Mexico, and sometimes there is no choice but to risk breaking American laws, but dont be surprised if the feds go knocking down your door to take you back. The reason why we dont let ANYONE in is because immigrants must first learn American history and tradition before they start living here. You shouldn't be called an American if you dont know what the country is built off of, freedom. (There's also economic reasons why there are strict border controls)	UCsbxd8FotbqtU08AbWkwpXg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsbxd8FotbqtU08AbWkwpXg	1	Uggo9V4C8NEVxHgCoAEC	MannyTrashCan

Meaning they are the people that are extremely unlikley to be able to come here legally, so what option do they have? Come here illegally to escape the drastic measures they were born into. There is a high probability that your family came here illegally. If you do think your family came here legally like mine. Then we are both lucky to have loos regulation on international borders depending in the political leadership at the time.

My mom and dad came here legally and they did teach me spanish, but they only talk to me inside the house not outside the never told me why, but I still talk Spanish outside the house to my friends who are learning and who need help. Most of the kids who were with me to school for the past 13 years of my life have been making fun of me because my family was Hispanic and making up lies that my fsmily came here "illegally" or that my "dad has a criminal record" and in reality he doesn't or that my "family is poor and can't buy a house" I had to hear those insults that werent even true with other students who were Hispanic who got the same insults. But I bet that some of thouse people who tell me that stuff happened to their families not just Hispanic's are immigrants other are as well and it can be from far back.

Two decades ago; however, it existed. When latin immigrants came to the US some became bilingual. Those "some" only passed on the language of English , due to fear of racism if they taught their children Spanish. Just to be CLEAR I am not talking about the 2000s. I am talking before that.

Your point, I assume, is that racism is less prevalent than the OP suggested? "Riddled with latinos" is not a polite way of saying "there are many latino immigrants in California." Not the same implication. You might as well have said "it's crawling with 'em."	UC19UCy3zFn8nzOfa4eT3Dqg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC19UCy3zFn8nzOfa4eT3Dqg	1	Uggo9V4C8NEVxHgCoAEC	MannyTrashCan

According to census data, nearly half of the people who identify as Hispanic or Latino are white. Hispanic is a broad, general term for people from places in the western world that were settled by Spain; Cuba, Mexico, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, etc. It technically has nothing to do with nationality, skin color, ethnicity. There are islands in the Caribbean that were claimed by Spain but never settled, which, I suppose, is why we don't think of people from St. Lucia, Barbados, St. Croix, Jamaca, et al. to be "Hispanic." The term was meant to generally describe a people with a shared cultural history, which seems kind of useless in 2017.

You are not wrong. The reason Manny wasn't taught Spanish at a young age depending on the age he currently contains will take us further back when Hispanics feared teaching their children Spanish due to the natural racist era we were in. It still exists ,but external forces have toned it down.	UCiD8P9a7983WhyluBTxkRhA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiD8P9a7983WhyluBTxkRhA	1	Uggo9V4C8NEVxHgCoAEC	MannyTrashCan

Though if you've done some, it will look good on your showreel. moving picture company is listed in the credits of this video. mpc probably did the trains going round the globe at the end. Maybe some scene transitions as well. If you don't know where to start download blender, follow some tutorials. Maya is the industry standard package though. Houdini for technical animation like explosions. It's hard to give advice because it depends on what level you are at at the moment.

And unlike most immigrants are humble and glad to be afforded an opportunity to live in this country. They earn their right to stay by working their asses off, not giving some BS centuries-old reason to why they own the land.

I believe that there were studies on Norse men inhabiting the area for a some time, but that's away from the subject. However the Native Americans were really the first to inhabit the area and start their own governable-type system should put them under Native. If not, then America really has no Natives since, obviously, the next groups to inhabit the area were from Britain, France, Spain, Italy (North and South) and probably some other's I've forgotten to mention. Really, America, and Canada both had spawned off of Great Britain with the initial exceptions of the 'Native Americans' and Norse Men. As far as I know, this is all very simple knowledge that I learned in grade school, with the exception of the more current Norse studies. If there are any questions or disagreements, do state them, but please try to refrain from vulgar statements. Hostility helps no one's case.

It's well known that they way US progresses in Science and Technology is by welcoming natives of any country ( Mostly Europeans ) who are inventors and discoverers and then monetize/capitalize on their creations. These scientists in many cases die relatively poor compared to the financial value of the product of their intellects. Even now the best brains in programming are East Europeans. They can hack the sh*t out of US systems. A brilliant Indian mathematician was once invited to Britain ( A country with a similar mindset ). The English were very perplexed and annoyed that an Indian "Beggar" ( He was an ascetic ) could come up with such brilliant ideas. Given freedom from subjugation people from any race and ethnicity can come up with brilliant ideas or products.That Indian mathematician was Ramanujan, a prominent contributor to Number Theory.

So, technically everyone immigrated to America from somewhere. Also, I think you meant America, not the US, which would be correct. America encompasses South America, Central America, and Northern America. The US and Canada happen to be a part of North America. Central America is where Mexico is located. This is just the ramblings of a 15 year old, however, so feel free to disregard me. I did check my facts btw.

It's sad to see all the negative replies but everyone has their own opinions. Like the song said "La mitad de gringolandia es territorio Mexicano" . I'm not just talking about Mexicans here and I'm also not being biased. I was born in the US. I'm Spaniard, Mexican, Italian, and a little bit of French. I speak perfect English and Spanish. My first language was Spanish but I prefer speaking English since I'm more fluent in it. My grandma is half Italian. Her and her siblings speak perfect Italian. They didn't teach their children Italian because they immigrated to Mexico and wanted them to fit in. I know a few words in Italian. And for the comment that said that if the US hadn't taken California, Arizona, and Texas from Mexico then it wouldn't be the land of opportunity... seriously??? You have obviously never stepped a foot inside of Mexico. If you literally just cross the border you will see an Asian community. Also, recently many African immigrants stayed in Mexico because the US wouldn't open their doors to them. The reason why I have European decent is because many of my relatives immigrated to Mexico... not the US! For safety and a better life. Mexico obviously gave them those opportunities.

The first point about someone having a claim to a piece of land is dumb. Everyone originated from the land between the Tigris River and Euphrates River. No matter your belief of evolution this is the most common start for civilization so yeah I learned some F******* history. To address the rest of the comments about it being racist is also dumb because the most oppressed group of immigrants were the Irish. I would suggest before you join the hate wagon to maybe read or even study up. Same with everyone commenting about how white racism is the worst thing against immigrants while in reality excessive nationalism is what created such poor job environments for workers (that sentence being said when you exclude the economic circumstance).

It's rather simple... Preferable to every nation being plagued with the problems they wish to escape... I also think that a state has a duty to it's citizens to care them first and foremost, as that's how the social contract works...

Everyone says how illegal immigrants fuck up the economy yet the economy flourishes because of them. They take the jobs no one else wants to do. Us as Americans believe everything should be handed to us but we don't want to put the work in. Everyone wants to complain about how they take the jobs and shit yet all they do is sit at home and complain instead of actually going out and look for one. If anyone is to blame it's the employer because they know they can pay them less which is why they hire them more.

The people that go to the United States go because they need help, they need protection, they need the work and they need the money. Unfortunately the United States is one of the countries with a lot of opportunities but its almost full of people like you and with your same racist and selfish beliefs. And for the record you don't know as much about family and protection of people you care about as you want to show us, if you support innocent people dying of bomber or falling into violence and crime only because you want them to have a paperwork and "a legal process" that can take more than 5 years only because they are muslim or latino people.

But fucking just letting anyone is the reason why there is so much violence and crime in the United States. So many cases of slaves coming from Mexico and South East Asia, illegal drugs that are killing families, over spending of taxes going towards free homes and food for people we don't know especially free college for their kids instead of my own. Your just a simple minded kid who hasn't seen the real world for what it is. You may really believe all the illegals who just come in are good poor innocent people, but sadly many of them are not the case. You' re just simple....

These people don't go to "your house" to steal if that's what you're thinking, the first thing ALL of they do is to start working. I know that you are typing this bulls**t because you haven't been in their situation, most of them come to this "glorious country" scaping from violence, poverty, and a lot of things more that you can't imagine because, as I said before, you haven't being in their situation.

Ugh-L-qvnQ0My3gCoAEC	1	1	2017-07-02 16:54:00	Alfa [ Migi ]	Call my argument void for having an anime picture but hear me out. Let&#39;s compare America to, let&#39;s say, London. London is already a massive pile of immigrants in their country and most of them are Muslims. What am I trying to say? Immigration, if done too much, could sadly destroy a country or change it in a way that it would be too far gone to fix. <br /><br />America, as it stands, is certainly close to imploding due to immigrants slowly getting in the country, Liberals absolutely still hate Donald J. Trump (like, just accept he&#39;s the fucking president and move on.) and absolute Anti-Fascists gradually becoming the fascists themselves. America is already a blinded country where only a few are actually awake. <br /><br />Before you crucify me in the comments, I voted for Bernie. I realized now that, I may not regret this decision, but I accepted Trump being POTUS. I didn&#39;t go outside yelling He Will Not Divide Us or hit somebody with a bikelock for not thinking what I like. I just accepted it. <br /><br />If Trump wants illegal immigrants deported, rally and scare him all you want. He&#39;s President now, accept this fact.

Billions of dollars in taxes come from undocumented workers who receive little to nothing in return. Those are people paying your social security, Medicaid, etc. who will not get there own in return. The labor of undocumented immigrants goes underpaid and under appreciated and it&#39;s despicable how people treat them.

UgiaP6pscVJmGHgCoAEC	0	2	2017-07-02 14:43:57	Removes Kebabs	Immigration in America has always been about subsidizing the class divide within the nation. Today it&#39;s about maintaining a slave class of illegal south American workers and has expanded to exploiting the labor of China, India, and anywhere else Americans are fine with enslaving their fellow men for a pittance. <br /><br />By supporting such immigration you only support the class divide in this nation. Those who call for unregulated, unlimited immigration are just the modern plantation owners who refuse to see those who toil in their fields every day. By supporting such immigration you support the brain drain on these peoples native lands. Their best and brightest leave their struggling people and lands behind, abandoning them for promises of a easier way forward and leaving their homes to the same fate of corruption and instability. <br /><br />Imagine how much good could be done if these people that are such hard workers actually tried to fix their homes and fight the destabilization visited upon them by our nation. <br /><br />That wont happen though, you&#39;re all too blind and want that American dream, to walk on someone&#39;s back.

The issue here is that most of the refugees coming over are never going to work and are literally forcing THEIR religion on US. Here in Finland 30k camel pissers came here and under 200 of them has a workplace. Rest of them are collecting welfare and raising crime rates in places where refugee centers are located. Don't even try to convince me that they're not getting any "opportunities" our government blows shitloads of money to them, but you can't buy motivation/will to integrate to our laws and habits.

There are people who look around and see that their country will not provide them a safe and happy life with plenty of opportunities to work hard under equal treatment. They themselves cannot create changes in their country, they can't fix their country to become an environment where they can achieve their dreams. Some of these governments are so corrupt and backwards, that it would take several decades and a multitude of people (who are being supressed by these regressive governments) to create necessary change. you can't expect people to grin and bear it when the leaders of their country treat them as less than human?? I mean the Pilgrims left England for North America because they wanted religious freedom from the church of England. don't tell me that it's suddenly wrong for me and my family to do everything we can for a better life, even if that means traveling across the world and assimilating in a place so different from our birthplace.

The fact is since they have been here, live here and have established themselves here over generations there is no logical reason to kick them out. Immigrants have just begun to move here and have proven their incompatiblity with western culture. Think about this: if a family member of yours broke something in your home would you kick them out the same way you would for a stranger?

There's about 20 things wrong with what you said, but the basic fact that undermines your entire outlook is: Islamic terrorists = the KKK in terms of frequency within their respective religions. So unless you wanna kick out all the Christians I suggest you learn that an extremely small percentage of a certain population being violent does not warrant a ban on the entire group. Discrimination aside, that's just a terrible idea from an efficiency standpoint. The fact that you can even type your comment on the internet proves immigrant fearmongering is working quite well. Hence the recommendation of independent news sources. Also, you should probably google the term "white terrorist." Because, and you may want to sit down for this, there are plenty of terrorists who have been white. To say otherwise is 1. ignorant, and 2. racist as all hell. How you even typed "all terrorists are Muslim" with a straight face is a (rather terrifying) mystery, assuming you're not a troll.

Its not a JDAM bomb but its hella close to one and even worse is that Europe allows this to go on in their very same back yards. If it were Shinto refugees or Buddhist refugees there would be absolutely no problem because that would be REAL refugees as they are proven to be peaceful people with honor and respect for host countries but for the past 20 years Islam has proven to be a radical religion, not all of them are radical but a dangerous portion are. This is why i call it an invasion because they have not proven to be a peaceful people and the saying that a few rotten apples spoils the bunch holds true.

White people arent unsafe in the country they were born. It isnt about conquering or coming in to sell drugs or whatever you think it is, its about being able to feel safe and protect yourself or your family. Like yeah illegal immigration is an issue but it's not because people are coming here illegally, it's because visas are stupidly hard to get. You want people to come here legally?

If you want to go to another country in order for better economic opportunities, you have to do extensive research and learn the customs of that country before coming in. I&#39;m an American citizen, but I had to move to China because of family matters and live there for 5 years or so. I had to learn Chinese in order to be able to integrate into that society. It kicked my ass, but I managed to suck it up and get to understand Chinese culture and language enough to live and work there, as well as earn a resident visa. If outsiders aren&#39;t willing to work hard to integrate themselves into the country they want to live in should not live there, plain and simple. Illegal immigrants can also sully the presence of immigrants who actually go through the procedures and become residents or citizens of the country, making it harder for them to live in the country. My dad and mom are both immigrants from China. They both grew up in poverty, worked their asses off in school, and made it to the US on student visas that they earned legally. They learned the language, attended university in here, and are now both fully fledged residents of the US who are now aiming for citizenship. Having illegal immigrants from China just appear in America actually made that process much harder for them to live their lives here, as they were judged many times by their immigrant status. All of you native-born white kids need to get off Tumblr and do the damn research to see how legal and illegal immigrants aren&#39;t part of the same group, and by loosening the rules for one could lead to extreme persecution for the entire immigration process, legal or otherwise.

See for example Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Kohlberg%27s_stages_of_moral_development). It's been a while since I've engaged in this model (which has its flaws). But as far as I remember, in higher stages the problem would be seen in more complexity. The situation would be important as well as the people involved in the scenes of illegal immigration/domestic abuse that you invoke. So, on the one hand, depending on the circumstances maltreating your family might be considered a worse crime than immigrating illegaly; furthermore - again, depending on the circumstances - illegal immigration might become some kind of technicality, especially if the supposed immigrant has high moral standards otherwise and treats others kindly. And I think on this point my argumentation already shows that I consider your description of "the unfriendly illegal immigrant" not so much one of character flaws but more one of behaviour. And, as shown, different behavioural patterns are interwoven with one another and judging them is, in my opinion, not as easy as you formulate it.

If any illegal immigrant yells at his wife and kids and treats everyone poorly, he still broke the law just as much as the good man who treats his wife and kids well who cane here illegally. both are guilty and we stop having a justice system if we say "he broke the law but he's nice so we'll let him go and he broke the same law and we won't let him go cause he's 'mean'".

Statistically, immigrants (documented and undocumented) are less likely to commit crimes. Undocumented people cannot receive "welfare," nor can they receive TANF, SNAP, Medicaid, or any other support programs. The closest they come, is what's called "Emergency Medicaid" and all it does is pay hospitals. Undocumented workers pay taxes, but see no personal benefit from them. The Constitution of the United States was based in part on the political structure of the Iroquois Nation, one of many Native societies with extremely structured social codes, specific territories, etc. Yeah.

UgisrrOMlCtOs3gCoAEC.8UVlBcQJ9-e8UoQwAsvu9z		1	2017-07-10 00:27:05	Drelgon	No, I was making a comment on how liberals and the no borders activist types are pro undocumented (and therefore illegal) immigration from places and cultures that are objectively inferior to western culture and values. These activists view of the world is childish in nature and willfully ignorant of reality, they think they are helping people by allowing them to come to the west illegally but all this does is put strain on the tax payer who will be paying for welfare most of these people, it will be importing culture that lowers quality of life and increase crime rates. The activists are probably middle class students in their bed rooms who will never have to live near these people and are only taking moral argument into consideration to make them feel good about them selves and have not a care for in the world for the working class of their on countries. Also when Europeans got to america they weren't immigrants, it wasn't a country. There were just warring tribes of uncivilized native Americans, it wasn't their land. A piece of land is only the property of those who draw a border then occupy and defend it. All throughout history wars have been fort so that people can expand their borders it was nothing new it was just the way humans were. The British were arguably the best at this practice. And this "america was built on immigration" line people like to use, yeah European immigration from the Europe where the culture was essentially the same as people from England and France set up the colonies there. The people that want to immigrate now are unskilled 3rd world people who will have barbaric cultures and who will provide nothing of value to the country or its economy.

The people and/or things who "opened the gate" are Lin-Manuel Miranda and the creators of this music video. They opened the floodgates, they were the first few drops of water in the massive tsunami of conversation, protest, and spreaded opinion to come on this issue. It's like the first snowflake - it encourages the others to come. The "barbarians" took the city - finally voicing their opinions, all thanks to the people who rallied them and opened the doors for them in the first place. I don't know if this is what the user actually meant, this is just how I interpeted it. I tend to try and look on the bright side of things, so I don't know if this made any sense. Just my opinion.

No other people will like to receive the jobs they get since they have a chance for something greater but if the immigrants didn&#39;t receive those low paying jobs , the high paying jobs wouldn&#39;t be nothing.. they (immigrants) make it happen..

YOU technically are illegal, sweetheart. if you are not native American, you came here on a ship or by land to start a new life. BY SHIP. it has nothing to do with race. please understand the 80 comments saying so. I come from immigrants, as do you. so if you still want to argue, lets talk jobs for a second, okay? Most of Mr presidents employees are immigrants, heck, his own wife is. lets go deport milania shall we? lazy rich Americans look down on working in stores, or COAL mines, or garbage dumps. but our beloved immigrants do our dirty work. so before you blindly follow a racist liar with your "make America great again" hat and sulk in the corner behind a screen, educate yourself, okay hunny?

You think liberal tears are delicious? Well that's not tears your tasting. It's sweat. Always sweating cause we're working to change America, some even changing the world. Making a difference isn't child's play. One little liberal at a time working harder then conservatives only talking in barter. Our ancestors, the founding fathers came as liberals trying to make a difference in their eyes and others. And even though at the time they weren't brothers United. Now that's our job. To change the world EQUALITY FOR ALL. And while your sitting on your ass tasting Liberal tears, don't forget liberals will make a difference in the world. We are who we are and nothing can change that	UCnAziCvoItKdwEbJkVcDqDg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnAziCvoItKdwEbJkVcDqDg	1	UgiuUeVzJ-BGoHgCoAEC	VETTSCALESL7

The strongest military in the world split up in two which could possibly destroy many things. It would also make the USA a lot weaker and more susceptible to things such as terrorist attacks which could possibly kill many people including you, your friends, and your loved ones.

There is no &quot;mostly good people&quot; or &quot;mostly bad people&quot;- there is no chart telling us how many people illegally immigrate to the US right now (for obvious reasons). There are hundreds of stories telling about how illegals murder and such, but also many that tell of how that same group of people are working hard trying to secure and sustain a life for their families. When all is said and done, at least in my opinion, the illegals are too dangerous to be given chances as they are- which is why our, albeit not great, immigration system exists. I do believe that this system needs many improvements but supporting a group of people that essentially rely on crime, whether intentional or not, to sustain their lives in America.

They&#39;re awesome people. <br /><br />None of them would ever appear in a music video, though. Which is interesting, because the whole point of this video is that immigrants are suffering, but here we have them as paid actors.<br /><br />So which is it?

I can&#39;t even begin to understand what these people are going through, but I do know that these people are some of the strongest. instead of having a ban to keep everyone out, we should be helping every immigrant that need it because the privileged say otherwise, but they would want other countries to help if we had to flee for any reason at all. the entire world would be so much better if we stood together than apart.

Yes there are illigals who come in the country while they could have done it legally in a way.

Sure it'd be nice if we could let in everyone and keep them safe, but what about the "immigrants" who aren't here to make an honest living and work for their families? And by that I mean the drug dealers, the terrorists, and in general bad people. It is sad that honest and good people have to be put into these categories sometimes but there really isn't a way for everyone to be safe if we just let everybody in.

Not all white people are racist, lazy bigots who think minorities are their slaves and should do all the hard work. Heck, most racist people live down in the south, and they're ironically white people who work hard and get their hands dirty, such as farmers.

UghRqAbxwsUahXgCoAEC	0	0	2017-07-01 15:28:37	Robert B	Liberals (Myself being one) think its grossly unfair people aren&#39;t paid living wages, especially for hard work. Yet somehow we celebrate a legal underclass, who are exploited due to their status, in order to do difficult jobs for far less than a living wage. In short, Liberals are advocating for a racially based underclass to exploit under conditions they wouldn&#39;t allow white Americans to work under as it would be &#39;unconscionable&quot;. (I say white because the big pushes for living wages have come from white, affluent, gentrified communities mostly)<br /><br />How does that make sense? We won&#39;t let a white Barista slinging coffee in an air conditioned building work for under 15$ an hour apparently; yet we&#39;re fine with brown people doing back breaking labor for in the scorching sun or brutal sweat shop conditions for off the book wages often less than 6$ an hour? If Americans don&#39;t want those jobs at the wages paid, it&#39;s because the wages paid are grossly unfair. Rather than Liberals fighting for better wages (Like the entire history of our progressive movement--which has been centered on workers rights), we have actually been duped into adopting a neo-conservative corporate strategy of advocating for an exploited caste of worker who will accept those wages. <br /><br />What happened to Liberals? When did it become progressive to import powerless workers and advocate they be ALLOWED to be exploited? That such a thing was NOBLE even? Have you all lost your damn minds? This would be like progressives of the last generation cheering scabs to Union bust since those uppity union workers wanted too much money and wouldn&#39;t work! It&#39;s a profoundly right wing, extremely laissez faire view of the world. As Bernie Sanders said, open borders are a Koch Brothers strategy that they have been pushing since Clinton (Which is why Clinton opposed it....)<br /><br />Unbelievable. Progressives have been brain washed in this country by corporate conservatives. Identity politics did for the right what the moral majority failed at--it made the exploitation of non-whites noble again. Sickening. Absolutely disgusting and you should be ashamed of yourselves for glorifying it.	UCEQe_QYrNqKUuxvtfHyBoTw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEQe_QYrNqKUuxvtfHyBoTw	0

UghxX80p1ZfzOHgCoAEC	0	1	2017-07-01 08:03:58	dabomb child	damn...this really hit me in the heart. As an African American black woman I&#39;ve always been scared to protest in black lives matter and immigration protests. this song really made my eyes open and empowered me to be a community activist, not only for blacks but for everyone. Especially after the election. Everyone is rioting instead of sticking together. If we build a strong bond like Hamilton an American musical has done for lots of young teens like me, we could build back our nation that God has created for us. I appreciate Lin and everyone else who helped make this, and I hope this struck others like it struck me. I just turned fourteen and I believe your are never to young to speak up and speak out; be an activist for your community.<br />God bless.

Why is it that millions of people are immigrating to the United States? I&#39;m personally not proud to be an immigrant. Because what we don&#39;t ask is why is it that Mexico and Central America is so underdeveloped that those countries aren&#39;t capable of providing its citizens a decent standard of living? Why is it that we don&#39;t connect neoliberal policies like NAFTA and Reagans dirty wars in Central America, to why immigrants are being driven in masses from their countries? Why don&#39;t we ask ourselves why xenophobia is taking of in America? Could it be that we are all suffering the consequences of an economic system (capitalism) that has failed to deliver the goods in America for the mass of citizens, while at the same time creating millionaires and billionaires and massive corporations that vote to leave the western developed world for the underdeveloped world. (Causing the anxiety that Americans are finding an outlet to by drinking the old toxic drink of Fascism) Those same millionaires and billionaires and multinational corporations conspiring to overthrow social democratic governments, such as Sandinos Nicaragua that this video so rightly points to and other countries in Central America, in the carribean in the Middle East and Aferica that forces those immigrants to naively travel to the United States looking for the American dream that no longer exists.

My dad has been working 6 days a week, 50-60hours a week as a car mechanic for 15 years (he started with a $200 paycheck every week trying to feed a family of 4). I am lucky to have hard working parents to raise me in the suburbs of the midwest. But that does not matter to the white trump supporters. Anyone who is brown &quot;needs to go back to your country&quot;. Most of the trump supporters probably do not even know the History of the States and what even happened in 1776.

Basically no one alive in America has ever been a slave or a victim in Mexican California. You ignore injustices occurring today, instead highlighting historical injustices because it provides you or people you prefer with privilege via pseudo victimhood status. If I am a victim of anything it is white/European weakness and treason. What happens in the nations we built are our own fault, I can't expect others to act in a way that is counter to their nature.

And the WASPs who oppressed and harassed and exploited them would have been resentful about the truth being told... and would be insulting them on &quot;youtube.&quot; Today, a lot of the formerly oppressed think THEY are the &quot;real Americans.&quot; They have forgotten their history and the treatment their ancestors received, and now need a &quot;lower&quot; group to scapegoat.

We have to cut off the locus that is trying to invade us as they swarm!!! Say NO to muslims, they are NOT a religion and their book proves it. It&#39;s an ideology. Plus, muhammad was self-declared profit who only was noted with one miracle where he rode on a donkey from mecca to Jerusalem. There were no witnesses! And, he never prophesied about anything. He got the koran from a demon, not by God. Plus, he is still in the grave, Jesus is not! But PLEASE, do not take my word for it, educate yourself, read, study and you will see it is a false religion with the foundation of pedophiles,¬†murders, and thieves. So tell me this, who would want to believe in that? Look at everywhere they go, like locus they devour and they&#39;re not a blessing! We as The United States of America must rise up before we are torn down and we MUST embrace our Latino brothers and sisters!!!

Britain wouldn&#39;t be where it is today without immigrants helping in the war. America wouldn&#39;t be here today without immigrants. If anything the immigrants that have caused the most terror and loss of life are white. But yet they&#39;re the ones who claim people &quot;immigrants&quot; are raping their kids. None of them will mention the amount of young girls that get raped by white Americans guys who are by the way immigrants themselves. But then again hypocrisy is just another one of their character traits.	UCjm-JqhsgiNCdpnL_Ba-9Yw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjm-JqhsgiNCdpnL_Ba-9Yw	0

Immigrants have the same prejudices as everybody else in this country. For example Mexican immigrants in parts of Los Angeles are literally killing black people in order to &quot;cleanse&quot; the neighborhoods of blacks, because they hate them. So don&#39;t push bullshit that &quot;ALL immigrants are just trying for a better life and want to be peaceful.&quot; Many immigrants (legal or illegal) are decent hardworking people, but many are also quite the contrary.

If you believe that shit, you must do some more research about that shit. If you say &quot;refugees&quot; welcome, you are just a sell-out. You WANT them to attack people, rape our women and blow up everyone/thing in name of allah. Isn&#39;t it a little strange that 95% of them are just men between 20-30, the age to be a soldier? Weird huh! Just search on youtube: Calais refugees, or Refugees attacking girl. Enough evidence if I may say.<br />If you still believe they are ALL innocent and peaceful, you must be a complete idiot.<br /><b>NOTE</b> I know they arent ALL bad, there are some refugees who actually seek help, but more then 95% is here just for financial advantage and to fuck it all up. The actual percent of actual refugees is smaller then the percent chance to win the lotery.	UCpmmwFYhzxqL3D8rOVr9gAw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpmmwFYhzxqL3D8rOVr9gAw	0

My dad found a job easily and he&#39;s had the same one ever since. It took my mom a little longer (because she didn&#39;t speak English) but we&#39;re completely stable now. I&#39;ve never been discriminated against because of it (although I can&#39;t exactly speak for my parents). I have so much respect for other immigrants who aren&#39;t as fortunate as we have been.

Immigrants come here and do the jobs american think they are too good for. the U.S was built by immigrants and if you want to get technical, only native americans should be here. But no, this is the immigrated country. The &quot;founding fathers&quot; of this country pushed out the ACTUAL natives but they purposed for immigrants to come here and feel free. Sure, put hate in the replys of this comment because I believe that we should all be given a chance. But think about being in the position of these people. Struggling to cross the border and have a chance of a good life, comming out of poverty and reaching their goals of a middle class lifestyle. No one is stealing your job if you already have one. Why dont we think about that. And some people think that because they dont have a job, an immigrant took their oppurtunity, if you didnt fill out an application, you never had a shot at a job.

That means learning its language, assimilating into its culture, going to work and making a life for yourself.<br /><br />Now it just means moving to another country, plundering the wealth of its working class through entitlements, and establishing a counter-culture to begin turning that land into the exact same place you fled from.

There&#39;s no &quot;I support legal ones&quot; camp. Its another way to say &quot;good/bad hombre&quot;. In reality it makes no difference. To racists every immigrant will look &quot;illegal&quot; and they will hide behind &quot;supporting the good ones&quot; like it always happens.

If first world countries share their wealth with everyone, than every first world country would have less to go around. If you&#39;re fine with poverty, then open the boarders. I know you people are all full of shit, because even if 1/100 homes were willing to take in the homeless, there wouldn&#39;t be homeless people. You don&#39;t, because you don&#39;t want to share the safety of your home, or your personal resources, because your quality of life would be reduced. If you won&#39;t help others at the personal level, than how can you hold a position that everyone else should through government action. Everything is a good idea as long as someone else pays the cost. <br /><br />Keep an eye on Europe, and watch what happens when the financial realities of mass migration results in cutting the welfare all those lovely migrants are getting right now. You&#39;ll get to witness first hand why everyone isn&#39;t welcome, proving once again why only Athenian fools accept gift horses.

UggwwnhQVc3TxHgCoAEC	0	0	2017-06-30 20:34:29	David T.	It is no doubt that the people who come here illegally are no doubt criminals, and must be dealt accordingly. No matter the cause, no matter the circumstances. These people is a disgrace to the people that spend years preparing for legal immigration and assimilation. The world doesn&#39;t run on feelings or empathy, and no sad pictures of a crying people is justification for letting millions of unskilled foreigners into the country.<br /><br />That being said Immigration is not without it&#39;s fair share of problems depending on why or how one chooses to immigrate.<br />This video mentions immigrants in general but by the overall feel, we can deduce that they meaning of the video is illegal immigrants and anti-immigration sentiment. The people that hate immigration aren&#39;t comically evil racists but people that feel a natural sense of self preservation against a force that will only cause harm in the US, the illegals.<br /> <br />Many Mexicans (as an example) choose to immigrate to the US because of the higher standard of living in the US, the ability to earn more money and the outdated dreams of being an American. They are economic migrants and only hope to catch on the wealth of the US. These people are coming here looking for a job and by that note, hurts the local population.<br /><br />Jobs<br />With more unskilled immigrants (typically illegal) coming into the country looking for the same type of job, which includes service jobs such as maids, farm help, or any kind of labor extensive work means that there is a larger work force for that field of labour. That means the values of these jobs are being lowered, why hire anyone for normal wages when you can hire an illegal that works for cents a days. This puts natives out of a job and it puts competitors out of a job because they can&#39;t compete with someone who have employees that can work for 1/10 a citizen works for. This is a cause for why there is a 4% unemployment rate in the US which is still 12 million registered Americans. Rather than open borders for unskilled workers to take so-called &quot;undesirable&quot; jobs for companies to make fatter profits off the enslavement of others, we need to make such more desirable for Americans by deporting these unskilled workers, thus lowering the work force for the field and increasing pay so Americans can find such jobs desirable. <br /><br />Also worth mentioning that the whole immigration situation with Mexicans basically encourages modern day slavery and human trafficking. Having looser laws on immigration will not solve this, it solves human trafficking but does not solve the problem of exploitation and modern day slavery. Modern day slavery isn&#39;t as black and white as you think it is, it&#39;s far more complex. Victims aren&#39;t chained up and owned but they are in a position that they cannot get out of. If an illegal talks out about better pay or conditions, the employer reports them to authorities and gets them deported while replacing them with another easily expendable migrant worker.<br /><br />Another problem is Assimilation<br />The people who immigrate to America bring their culture and experience to America, and that&#39;s okay as long as they assimilate to American society and culture. This is not the case with Mexican immigrant who feel great pride in their home country, which makes you reconsider why they came here in the first place or where their loyalty is placed. These Mexicans immigrate and settle near other Mexicans in Mexican dominant areas, (funny enough is that these minority dominant areas are the ones usually most dangerous for people and a no-go area for police) where they freely practice their cultures without ever needing to conform to American society. That is a problem because that means a compete disregard of the native population and culture.<br /><br />Immigration harms the native problems at the benefits of businesses that stopped caring for the people long ago.

We MUST, and I mean WE MUST make legal immigration easier to obtain. All of my family members are immigrants (except for me) and we are all very fortunate to be citizens. However, it took us a while. Not too long, but around 4 years, I believe. We need to fix this.	UC02xxdEeOjBPYsbl41imlFA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC02xxdEeOjBPYsbl41imlFA	0

Today he has no status yet he has made a name for himself and created his own engineering firm and has even hired multiple American college graduates to work for him. All without asking for a single dollar from the government or taxpayers, even though he was very well able to. Yes there are many people who come to the west for benefits only but there are also those of us who pulled ourselves up by our own bootstraps without the help of anybody, and that means something	UCV8F4tMZQdlVyVqINXwnkfg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCV8F4tMZQdlVyVqINXwnkfg	0

Then my dad ran from his family because they abused them, lived on the streets at 17, and got fired from his job since rich white people kept suspecting him of stealing from their coats because he was Arabic. He came to Britain, taught himself the language on his own, and worked his way up to owning his own fucking restaurant, serving the food of his home country, employing almost entirely immigrants and being famous city-wide for how good his establishment was. He worked his ass off to get to where he is today, and he is the kindest, most generous person I have EVER met.<br /><br />I&#39;m the child of an immigrant who was the child of immigrants, and I think it&#39;s fucking disgusting that people would accuse my family of &quot;stealing jobs&quot; or &quot;not working hard enough&quot;. I&#39;d like to see those people do what my family have managed to do.	UC5BgJUdRzFi70TNaey-QF8A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5BgJUdRzFi70TNaey-QF8A	0

Like I said earlier, I'm just not very educated on these more serious topics, so I much prefer to seek out Hamilton fangirls/boys, rather than these real-world problems. 'Cause honestly, I come to Youtube to escape reality. To escape the politics, terrorists.. serious stuff that I don't understand, and stress about. Conversing with my Hamilfans helps me block out reality. Reading these debates only bring reality back. Of course, you could argue that it's good to acknowledge reality and not block it out.. but I just don't see it that way. I find that the purpose of the internet is to help entertain, relive stress, forget your problems. But the internet also provides information on reality. On these serious topics. So you could really argue about both sides of the scale... At the end of the day, this is all opinion-based, and overall, worthless. But we continue to do it anyway. Isn't that strange? I find it strange. This is all pointless. What is life?	UCFsTjM3rdzA2NW3LGEWdOvQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFsTjM3rdzA2NW3LGEWdOvQ	1	UgjhuXf2rxWZyHgCoAEC	Fletcho

To want the 'old' comment section back is to BLATANTLY IGNORE THE PURPOSE OF THIS VIDEO. This video was NOT made for fan-girl/boy/whatevering over how great the musical is. It was made to bring ATTENTION to problems in America and the hypocrisy of immigration debates. So, no. If you want to squeal about how great the Hamilton musical is, I will gladly join you on a video who's purpose is for entertainment in regards to the musical. But this video is attempting to spread fire in people's hearts and spark debates about a serious issue affecting many.

If it were real life, then maybe I'd have a few words to say on the matter, but even that'd be unlikely. I know that I don't possess enough knowledge in either subject to insert ~my~ opinion into theirs without sounding like a child, so I tend to avoid these debates. I'd rather be a bystander, which I think is a lot more entertaining. And one final note, I'm just here to simply enjoy the music. I'm a big fan of rap, and I'm a big of Hamilton. Of course I'm gonna replay this song 30 times a day 'till I get physical sick from not eating properly, and instead attempting to rap the entirety of this song. And of course I'm not gonna actively try to engage in debates with strangers online. This'll hopefully be my last comment. I probably made things worse by posting this, but I'm just here for the music. Not the comments. Though if I had more knowledge on politics and immigration, maybe I'd be participating in these debates, too. But as of now, I have more important things to worry about. Like getting a decent report card.	UCFsTjM3rdzA2NW3LGEWdOvQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFsTjM3rdzA2NW3LGEWdOvQ	1	UgjhuXf2rxWZyHgCoAEC	Fletcho

UghO5t-_ukXab3gCoAEC	0	1	2017-06-30 19:31:00	Strings of Air	People need to wake up and look at the reason that immigrants are leaving their country and coming to the US, if they want to come here for a great chance to work hard and contribute the US because their country is so terrible, why don&#39;t they stay in their country and use the chance they have there to improve things for their country and their people? Instead they come here for the &#39;welfare state&#39; and hide from the law, to take from others and give to themselves.<br /><br />They don&#39;t care about improving sh!t for anyone but themselves, they would be back in their country marching, protesting, writing legislatures, or holding an overthrow of their oppressive government so that they could have a great life and a great chance for themselves and their countrymen, and all generations to come.<br /><br />This is the rule for illegal immigrants, there are exceptions to the rule, but all illegal immigrants are criminals, they are all breaking the law by coming over in illegal ways, or overstaying visas, it is a criminal offense that is not often enforced or punished. We should look to the EU and treat our illegals like they treat people that overstay their visas (they do this to people that overstay the 90day limit by even 1 day, detention in a police facility, and likely blacklisted from returning)	UCJ7nBo4SnClQlD9wY4jFQfA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ7nBo4SnClQlD9wY4jFQfA	0

This study (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15625622) found that they could guess with 99.86% accuracy what race somebody belonged to by analyzing their genetic structure and grouping them into clusters. If these scientists are simply engaging in phrenology by doing machine learning on genetic cluster analysis then you should write to them and tell them that they are frauds. They'd love to hear it! "Race" is just an arbitrary distinction and the line can be drawn anywhere but the map you are drawing it onto is still real and there are still very real differences between human groups, in some cases the genetic distance (known as the FST-index) between human sub-groups is _already_ greater than the distance between certain animal groups that we already classify as a different sub-species. We could classify human sub-groups as a sub-species too if we wanted to, we just don't because it would upset sensitive children like you. As for why I care, the same reason you would care if someone was living in your house who you did not know and you could not trust. Robert D. Putnam did a decadal study (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_D._Putnam#Diversity_and_trust_within_communities) on the effects of diversity and found that it overwhelmingly reduces social trust, cohesion and social capital. Knowing these facts and them asking me why I would intentionally want my society to reduce its capital and trust levels for no reason should be a no brainer. And aside from all that, I simply just want to live around my own people it's normal and natural even though it goes against the significant brainwashing you have experienced since childhood.

Ugi4_aLXF8JSqHgCoAEC.8URfBke32Sx8UWiFoEaQ_y		14	2017-07-02 18:01:37	holden hodges	AugustusPugin Here's an important question. Why does it matter what skin color people on Earth have? We're all the exact same species of animal, and that is scientifically undebatable. So, why does it matter if the people in 3000 have a different skin color? Why do you care about what race someone is? Because of you're going to make some sort of shitty argument about "genetics," you're relying on psuedoscience that uses the same theories as phrenology from the 1800s.

Up until 1965 the immigration policy was the country was open to whites of good moral standing. If any country is not homogeneous it will not last. This applies to all countries even the ones where whites dont live. Cultural differences are the result of genetic differences among other things that cannot be changed. Say its racist, doesnt matter, America should be at least 80% white. Everyone deserves a homeland. No one says one word about Asian or African countries or israel being ethnically homogeneous. Europe and North America were white countries and should have stayed that way. The more mixing that occurs the quicker they will fall apart and become third world shit holes like the places many of these people come from. Hate on whites all you want, there is a reason that everyone else wants to live in countries we settled and none of us want to live anywhere else. Also please dont start with the slavery and colonization bullshit. Both were a net negative for all countries that practiced them and that is a fact you can look up. Remember too that whites were the first to outlaw slavery and definitely not the first to start it. Walk through any neighborhood that isnt majority white and you can see what multiculturalism actually is.

They come from countries with governments so corrupt, that their "leaders" themselves are complicit in many instances of organized crime. Journalists covering stories, killed by corrupt police officers. Mayors and police officers threaten journalists more often that DRUG CARTELS in Mexico. 43 Students disappeared back in 2014. 43 humans vanished. Unfortunately, in counties outside of places like the US, horrors like this happen often if not daily. So sure illegal immigration may be becoming a problem, but having a mindset so ignorant and clouded by privilege helps no one. Please just try to be more empathetic towards people who are suffering at the hands of their own countries. Realize not everyone has it good- or even mildly alright.

UggAazy8F8fXpXgCoAEC	1	0	2017-06-30 16:36:47	Bet On Me	Someone misused the term &quot;immigrant&quot;. The term divides into two subterms: legal and illegal. Both have completely different meanings. Stop propaganda, man. It&#39;s useless. People that pay taxes always fight off illegals because they steal jobs from legals (who pay taxes), whilst contributing literally nothing to any country and especially its market. And a nation, that you work for, is all that a country&#39;s about - if you don&#39;t like it, go somewhere else. I don&#39;t even have to remind any of you (but I will, either way) that you, as a legal immigrant, pay taxes for those illegals every single day, yet when you meet them, they never say &quot;thank you&quot; in return. They hide their emotions like cockroaches, always poker-faced, never even being thankful for what a country they immigrated to personally gives to them. Look at Europe - is any of those illegals thankful? Find me only one and paste a link here, please. What&#39;s worst, illegals never conrtibute to any tax-system. They literally work for their own money, not yours. Not for any of us. We all know that, when it&#39;s legal, we all work for the money and wealth of all the people, all of us, not our own money right here, right now. Is the act of stealing jobs from legal <br />work entities something to be advertised or propagated by music videos? Ask yourself, man. ;) This music video said nothing about legal, respectable immigrants. You must be blind not to see that in cases like this, it&#39;s an obligation to discern the term legal from illegal, because both are what this topic&#39;s all about. Without it - it&#39;s only propaganda. I say no to any propaganda.	UC5c8HhfbZ2kmSSh-fiXvf9Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5c8HhfbZ2kmSSh-fiXvf9Q	0

On average, illegal immigrants cause the US a fiscal deficit of $14,397 per household annually. My friend's father was an immigrant (now a citizen) who entered the immigration process in the right way. He works way too damn hard, and pays way too many taxes to cover his family, let alone 11.3 million other people. Think about it. Let that sink in for a while. Then make conclusions about illegals and trust music videos like this one. ;)	UC5c8HhfbZ2kmSSh-fiXvf9Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5c8HhfbZ2kmSSh-fiXvf9Q	1	UggAazy8F8fXpXgCoAEC	Bet On Me

We need to find a balance as a country. Where we welcome immigrants with open arms. Unlike in the history when the Natives had the disadvantage of not speaking french, spanish, or old english. Now it&#39;s the immigrants with a disadvantage, they come here not because it&#39;s easy, because it&#39;s not. They must get an education, learn english, they get backlash whenever in public. As a country we need to view the past as wrong but view our future as right.	UCG6iC71WNTEq7XJ4nx5HOzA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG6iC71WNTEq7XJ4nx5HOzA	0

So by your logic if your related to someone who did something in the past therefore you are evil and terrible. I've seen immigrants rape, steal, kill, torture and do terrible things to other people, so is it safe to say that every one of those immigrant's children are gonna be like them? and when they have children will they be terrible? By your logic every single person is whatever their ancestors are. And since every single civilization has gone to war sometime in human history EVERYONE is a murder and horrible person. But of course you not gonna think like that. Your only gonna think in the way that excuses YOUR ANCESTORS MISTAKES but gets to bash on Americans. Also if your trashing people for not knowing history I assume your must be an expert because by your logic ONCE AGAIN if your not a expert in what your talking about then you shouldn't talk about it. So? Are you an expert? You talk about us getting blinded yet your obviously brainwashed by people around you talking about the past when their ancestors have done unspeakable things.

But I will go along with your hypothetical. My grandfather is Hitler and he killed a bunch of Jews. Would I be ashamed? Yes. But im not gonna let his mistakes let YOU decide if im a bad person or anything like that. What my ancestors did don't reflect on my judgement or personality. Why do you keep making that assumption?? Also besides making up some hypothetical barely relevant to the argument you didn't even answer my question... Also nice job playing the moral card like your just so much better then me. Typical of someone like you. Yes they were treated bad I never said they weren't... But the fact that your trying to say that because of my ancestors decisions im stupid, a bad person or whatever the fuck you wanna call Americans is completely insane. Im not gonna just let you GENERALIZE a whole group of people (sound familiar??) and say they're horrible people because our ancestors made bad calls. Ill say it one more time so you can actually understand something from this argument. All caps too. MY ANCESTOR'S DECISIONS AND MORAL STANDERS DO NOT AND I REPEAT DO NOT REPRESENT OR SHOW WHAT I BELIEVE, THINK OR FEEL ABOUT ANYTHING OR ANYONE . And there you go. Stop being a asshole and try to use your head if your gonna call a group and people morons.

There have been numerous studies done on how much countries benefit from immigrants. For one thing, they are educated, they bring more ideas to America. Einstein was an immigrant. They also tend to be less hostile. They are less likely to misbehave then American-born people, why? Because they are afraid of getting deported. Refugees and immigrants aren't people to be afraid of. They don't "steal" your jobs. They work the jobs you refuse to work. And what do you mean there's no song for hardworking Americans who have it hard??? There are so many I can't even begin to count them. Everyone except Natives are immigrants, or descendants of immigrants. You don't get to cherry pick who counts as an immigrant and who doesn't. Study's have shown that immigrants work harder than people from America and they still get crap from people like you about not being educated. You're entitled to your opinion and I understand that you're probably afraid of immigrants, but you, everyone in this comment section need to just take a step back. Before you jump to defend your ill-informed opinion, research both sides. That's what I did, and it helps put things in perspective. Plus it'll make your argument stronger. In short, immigrants are educated and they're wrongly accused of not being so, they are discriminated against for purely being an immigrant. Research your opinion and facts before you speak,	UC2TzIUAHhrFBiOgeRYQFYng	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2TzIUAHhrFBiOgeRYQFYng	1	Ugjmu7BrtlXm_3gCoAEC	Campos

In this case of immigrants though, I assume everyone here are talking about Latino immigrants. Big American businesses exploit your people for cheap labor, thats what immigrants are for. Most immigrants are so poor and desperate for money, they would just take any job (because its America, duh). Not only that, undocumented immigrants make up for more than 30% of the kidnappings and 10% of murder cases in America. Considering they make up for only 3.4% of the American population, thats an alarming crime rate for their demographic. I'm the only one here who gave numbers instead of just recalling something they learned about colonialism in 6th grade, I'm amazed how little research the internet does.

And if you ask all of the first immigrants had slaves and thought black people were apes, so you're retarded to compare todays immigrants to the old immigrants.

Most Irish descendants forefathers immigrated after the US gained independence. So those Irish/Italian/Eastern European descended Americans (approx 80%+ of the US population) would all be defined as immigrants and not have right to live in the US. Makes complete sense you ignorant cuck.	UCISJSu_dJl7eh2VpiRMdFCw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCISJSu_dJl7eh2VpiRMdFCw	1	Ugjmu7BrtlXm_3gCoAEC	Campos

BUT I&#39;m an American through and through, born and raised and there&#39;s other born and raised Americans whether they be Black, White, Asian etc (who aren&#39;t immigrants) who get the damn job done too. And on the flip side, I know immigrants who have come to this country (The U.S.) with this sense of entitlement and whom feel that they deserve special privileges because they are immigrants. Give me a break. I also have known immigrants who come to this country on visa from their rich families and do nothing but love off their mommy and daddy! And yes, on the other flip side I know Americans who are lazy and don&#39;t want to do an &quot;immigrants job&quot;. <br /><br />At the end of the day, my point is that if you&#39;re out there working your ass off (immigrant or not), making your dreams come true and not acting like anything is owed to you, I got nothing to say to you. But as American, I also don&#39;t want people telling me how hard I don&#39;t work, when I sacrifice my weekends getting at at 5am when others are done with a night of partying. Just to make sure I get to do and get the things I want in my life. I don&#39;t want an applause, a cookie or a medal but I&#39;m just saying. Hard working people are hard working people, period.

After you live the way they do for a long ass time then you can say shit but only from experience but if you don't have any experience in any way or know how hard they work just to get dinner on the table for their little ones most left their countries for a better future for their little kids and I think that it is great that they were thinking about the generation to come instead of themselves so I suggest you shut the fuck up they work hard for everything they have it may not be Adidas Nike or Jordans but at least their children have something and those children are amazing because at a young age they learn to value everything and everyone which is great, and you should not be saying stuff like that because those illegal immigrants children are working hard for their future and they will be the next generation taking care of this country instead of saying stuff like that I suggest that you should support them	UCGWTmoGNDLlFByHruWisLFA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGWTmoGNDLlFByHruWisLFA	1	UghEM6DcgifkwHgCoAEC	supersonicfeed -

Now we have an uneducated RACIST as prez and all the closet racist came running out not scared to show their HATE. When he leaves the WHITE house DON&#39;T you hide again. Black and Latino UNITE! That&#39;s the only way to beat the white racists. I say Black and Latino cause those are the two biggest people of color in this country. Asians like to obey and are scared of whites they would never unite against them. That&#39;s the only reason they called them &quot;the model minority&quot; because they obey the white people and accept the hate. Blacks and Latinos DON&#39;T put up with it. PEACE!!!

UgiBCkl1LG3zlHgCoAEC.8UR8-2pA9z78UY2Mbng4NQ		8	2017-07-03 06:25:17	Charlie Evangelista	Okay hold up. As an Asian (Filipino-American and first generation American at that), I need to step up for my people. My parents worked hella hard to come to this country. To this day, my mom still asks me if her English is alright when her accent is barely detectable. Both of my parents grew up in poverty, but have worked their asses off to provide for me and my sister. They talk to me about political issues sometimes, and my dad in particular doesn't stand for racism of any kind. Personal history aside, let's talk about world history shall we? Specifically Japan and India as they are probably the best examples of kicking white butt (that being said, Asians have kicked butt many times, but I'm not planning on writing a novel in the comments section). Japan is part of the G8 and is argueably the most industrialized country of the continent. Japan knew something was up after China was forced into an unfair trade deal with Britain thanks to the Opium Wars (don't do drugs kids). The sirens started going off as soon as Japan had Americans knocking at their door to open routes for trade. So what did they do? First, they opened up trade because Japan was not ready to suffer the same fate as China. Then the Meiji Restoration happened, which was basically a) bring back the emperor and b) INDUSTRIALIZATION BITCHES. Fast forward a few decades and we all know what happened to poor Japan after America dropped the atomic bombs. Did they stand around and do nothing? Hell naw! Japanese products are the craze my friends. If anything, they'll take over America faster than the Manifest Destiny drove all those poor Native Americans out of their homes. Second, fricking India. Now before I go into India, let me just say that there have been a lot of Asian empires throughout history. From the massive but short-lived Mongol Empire to Japan's takeover of the Pacific coast, it would be ignorant to say that Asians were pushovers. Hell naw brother, they were the ones doing the pushing. Back to India. India was still a British colony after WWII. Due to the shortage of British soldiers, the British decided to get some soldiers from their colonies, including India. India had already been through a lot of crap from those stinking British, but losing people to a tedious war just crossed the line. However, India ain't gonna lost anymore people. Enter the all powerul kick ass Ghandi. With his advocating of non-violent approaches, he and his followers managed to declare independence. Of course, this is the short story, but it's important to remember that we Asians can kick white ass too, just like how Martin Luther King Jr. and others managed to non-violently stand up (or sit down depending on who you're talking to) to oppression. I think you have to remember something: all minorities are still fighting for their rights, but not everyone in a minority wants to go against the majority. This goes for everyone, not just Asians. I just want you to remember that we aren't weak. We're on the same boat as you. Let go of the steering wheel captain: we're in this together.

Some of my family is Spanish and Black so I can partly understand. My father (who is black) also told me that what every they teach you at school about Europeans making blacks into slaves is correct, but they were already doing that to themselves. They were already enslaving their own kind, it just became more harsh when the Europeans did it. Honestly I don't understand why you said fight and unite when there is no need. That was in the past, everyone is free and has the choice to do what they want. This makes me angry to see certain races trying to start a war out of nothing. Leave the past in the past. We could all be so powerful if we all came together and pushed each other up and not bring some down. Even though racism will never be over we should at least try to include every race and not just two.

Tell me how many muslims mexico has taken in?? what about japan? what about brazil? what about angola??? oh that is right fuck all yet they love do demand free entry to our countries and label us racist whilst not doing anything themselves when the capital of mexico is less then 50 percent Mexican when they are crushed beneath the truck of a jihadist then they can have the right to act as they do now but only then.

Ughq6OKtHsa633gCoAEC	0	1	2017-06-30 12:19:47	Noah DeGuzman	1st things 1st I have conservative bias.<br />Now that that is over with time to address the video. This video never expressed either illegal or legal immigration. So I have no problem with this video and I fully support immigration as I myself am 1st generation and I have many friends who have immigrated from various countries around the world. I recognize the effort and time it takes as well as the challenges that face and I respect them deeply for that.<br /><br />However I don&#39;t agree with the modern support for illegal immigration. I feel that living in America is a privilege not a right and you shouldn&#39;t have all the benefits of being an American citizen unless you are an American citizen. In modern times there is too much turmoil around the world to justify open borders. While there are many hardworkers and skilled laborers immigrating there is also the various problems associated with our borders such as drug and human trafficking that make it too cumbersome to allow. That is also ignoring the heavy economic shifts that may occur which we wouldn&#39;t be able to compensate for.<br /><br />Just my 2 cents	UCeo_I_IdffiV1WzWUYsUrUw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeo_I_IdffiV1WzWUYsUrUw	0

This isn&#39;t about putting down Americans and giving Latino men and women a reason to taget others. This is showing the underdogs of society. The workers and families that came to America for the same reason we seem to stay; the American Dream. They however didn&#39;t get it handed to them on a silver platter but had to WORK for it. If you think about it, the Latino community is the most hard working and under paid in this nation. This song is pretty much a big &quot;HEY WE ARE HERE TO STAY&quot; comment. They aren&#39;t here to ruin lives and take jobs. Its not their fault they qualify for the hard jobs most Americans are to lazy to do themselves.

UggKTn0yAAcbCngCoAEC	0	0	2017-06-30 11:53:06	Dawn	The law of cause and effect applies to everything. Example - If farms don&#39;t have labor to harvest, than we have produce shortages and the price goes up. That is the simplest way to explain the economics of deporting a large labor force that works in exploitive conditions for very little pay. And they do so without complaint because they know to do so would mean the threat of deportation. So the next time you buy produce at the store, consider the true cost of how it got there.

If you&#39;re so hardworking and valuable why are you committing crimes in disproportionate numbers and relying on public assistance? Yeah, my ancestors were immigrants, but they were European immigrants, and European immigration is not tantamount to the present day&#39;s mass migration from the third world. Sorry, but Somalians, Mexicans, and Arabs are nothing but a burden on the Western world and many are waking up to this fact. Your people are genetically and culturally incompatible with white Europeans. You all are genetically predisposed to voting for retarded fiscal and social policies that crashed your home nation&#39;s into the ground and you will do the same even in the developed world. You are dragging us down to your level and quite frankly I&#39;ve had enough of you all and your bitching and whining. In general, European-American men do not take kindly to the nihilistic, socialist and degenerate lifestyles that you people bring to our country. Your culture is nothing but decadence and blaming others for your problems. I seriously hope that one day I can personally eliminate (and by eliminate I mean remove you. Of course I am not advocating for killing or genocide. I am just advocating for &#39;removing&#39; you from the confines my nation.) every single one of you from my nation because you have done nothing to move my country forward. YOU ARE ALL A BURDEN ON MY COUNTRY. GET THE FUCK OUT. <br /><br />For my fellow whites: Save white America. Don&#39;t fall for this shit. If you do continue to allow unfettered immigration from these shithole countries, America will resemble nothing but a massive favela in due time. These people are GENETICALLY PREDISPOSED TO STUPIDITY AND IMPULSIVE BEHAVIOR. THEY WILL ELECT EVEN MORE CORRUPT LEADERS AND WILL UP YOUR TAX RATES AND GOVERNMENT SPENDING. THEY WILL COMMIT MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF CRIME AND DRIVE DOWN YOUR PROPERTY VALUES. THERE WILL NO LONGER BE A SAFE NEIGHBORHOOD LEFT IN AMERICA IF THIS CONTINUES. THEY WILL OUTBREED YOU. THEY WILL FORCE THEMSELVES INTO EVERY LAST CRIME FREE WHITE MAJORITY SCHOOL AND TOWN. THEY WILL ENFORCE MARXIST AGENDAS THAT PUT YOU DOWN FOR BEING WHITE. TAXES WILL BE SO HIGH THAT OWNING CAR, A HOME, OR EVEN AN EXPENSIVE VIDEO GAME CONSOLE A FUCKING PIPE DREAM. JUST GO LOOK AT THE COST OF GOODS IN COUNTRIES LIKE BRAZIL WHERE SHITSKINS HAVE DESTROYED THEIR ECONOMIES. SAVE THE LAST FEW BASTIONS OF WHITE AMERICA BEFORE ITS TOO LATE. OR YOU AND YOUR CHILDREN WILL END UP LIVING IN A WORLD WHERE EVERY NEIGHBORHOOD IS SURROUNDED BY GATES AND EXPENSIVE SECURITY SYSTEMS. YOUR BEAUTIFUL WINDOWS WILL SOON BE OBSCURED BY IRON BARS TO PROTECT YOU FROM THE SAVAGE NEO-BRAZILIANS THAT ROAM THE STREETS AT NIGHT. REMEMBER THAT TIME YOU COULD TAKE A NICE CALM RELAXING EVENING STROLL? SORRY. YOUR TOWN NOW HAS A GANG PROBLEM BECAUSE YOUR MARXIST GOVERNMENT INVITED 100,000 SOMALIAN MIGRANTS TO SETTLE IN YOUR CITY.

But there are just too many side effects. For example, because a large portion of illegals are unemployed and rely on government funds, that forces the middle class taxpayers to spend more. along with this , there is also the threat of terroristic attacks¬† and crimes. my thoughts are to just come here legally, just like my family line and many others. although it might take a few years, its the right way to o it.

Accept them as people not savage aliens from another galaxy. Jesus Christ I don&#39;t care what religion you are or what race you are. Some of the US is acting like 5 year olds on a school playground, grow the fuck up. Just because they grew up somewhere else, have more or less melanin, practiced a different religion than you have doesn&#39;t mean they are wrong and you&#39;re right and that they&#39;re all savages taking the jobs you won&#39;t take and want to kill us all, respect and accept eachother or else everything will end because of these ridiculous mindsets other people have.

This narrative about America being closed off to immigration is total manufactured bullshit. When my parents were born this country was 90% White/European descendants. And now when I have my first child, they will be a minority in their age group. What other country in history has gone through such a rapid demographic shift in such a short period of time? Why are we told that these trends are normal and that we&#39;re racist if we disagree with it? Wake the hell up people!

I understand that it&#39;s a hard process to attain citizenship, making illegal immigration seem appealing, but why should some have to go through the process, and others get a free pass? And if the conditions in these countries are so bad that so many people need to emigrate into the United States, why don&#39;t we fix these countries?

I am completely tired of y&#39;all Americans acting all righteous as if we as immigrants are destroying your lives. Immigrants keep these countries running. I&#39;m from a family of Chinese immigrants, and we worked our asses off to make it here. Learning English, surpassing our white counterparts, becoming better than those who arrived to this country before us? That&#39;s us, making our way in these countries. Not us &quot;stealing your jobs&quot;. Not us being &quot;disrespectful&quot;. Stop asking whether or not you should take on immigrants and refugees, and start asking: &quot;When, where, and how?&quot; You don&#39;t hear people complaining when they use medication and other technology made by immigrants.

I don&#39;t see any of us speaking the language of native Americans. Why is that? is it because Immigrants didn&#39;t want to assimilate? When you got a family to feed. Waiting 10+ year for an opportunity to come here legally in not really an option. If you can support you family for those 10+ year then why leave in the first place. It takes 5 years to become a citizen after you have received your resident card. At the end of the day its all about survival. What are you willing to do to make sure your family is ok. To the people against immigrants would you sit at home and watch you family starve to death or risk it all for an opportunity of a better life? If you haven&#39;t lived it then you most likely won&#39;t understand it.	UCs8h9dlRa8l-pD2NnoY0ihA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs8h9dlRa8l-pD2NnoY0ihA	0

Why we are so great is that we are constantly improving on our country, making life better for everyone, yet you can look back and point out terrible things we did to people in our own country. 2nd, not all immigrants are illegal, and they seriously help our economy. The ones that illegally entered to us or overstayed their visa, they shouldn't have, but if they literally built a life here it's cruel to kick them out. Next, it is hypocritical to look at another country and belittle them for their immigration policy when we are working so much on ours, for better or for worse. Pointing out someone else's problem is okay, but failing to point out our own goes to the point of idiocy. Finally, though I don't agree with the threat of moving to Canada, they probably are not moving there because of the people's race, since Canada is about as racially diverse as America, but how progressive and easy it is. Moving there costs money yes, but most places speak the same language, have more progressive laws, and has universal health care for every citizen. Overall, it's just easier. I do not mean to offend in my reply to you, but I feel as if you are ignoring what this video is about. It is literally telling us that immigrants are the backbone of society and not to hate. So, please don't spread hate towards those whose beliefs differ from yours, but instead try to see where they are coming from. Please.

You make the assumption that people have a right to enter the U.S. no one has a right to enter another country. As for the second problem, the Indians did not have an established nation when the colonists landed. Now let me be clear, I'm not advocating what the colonists did, but a more advanced culture taking out a primitive one is nothing new in history.

It took well over 10 years to go through the process. Now what I said in my original post was that when waiting those 10 years is not an option what are you going to do?

Different tribes didn't even speak the same language. There was and will be no "America" without the descendents of the european settlers who founded this country and continue to maintain its values. This is a nation, not the world's dumping ground. Maybe you should be grateful for the people who founded a country where you're free to espouse such things instead of shitting on them and trying to replace them with a population that is more likely to emulate the values of the societies they left. If these immigrants are so wonderful, then why aren't the places they leave the most prosperous placed on earth? Oh, right. This is a propaganda video.

They are just searching for a better life and want to escape the ruins of their country. If it wasn&#39;t for them, many low paying jobs wouldn&#39;t have workers.

We have illegal immigrants because it so hard to actually become a legal immigrant, sometimes years and some people can't wait that long. Also they are not taking advantage of the system, it's harder being a illegal, they maybe working for long hours in poor conditions just to get enough money to feed their families. You don't understand what they have to go though just to come here to get away from their past and people like you want to throw them back like trash you didn't want here. I think you forgot that these immigrants are people who want to live a better life in America. Almost forgot, you spelled become wrong and have poor typing skills.

Do you even realize how egocentric and selfish that sounds ? Thankful? The Natives were put into SLAVERY. They were slaughtered and raped and put down by your ancestors. Stop the "it's called conquering a land you dolt" please. You had no right. Even at the time, what did the Brits with America was forbidden by all laws, it's just that the indians were not considered humans at the time. Also, America violated their own laws : at first, the Indians still had lands, then the Pilgrims violated the agreement they wrote themselves in order to steal their lands. Some of you clearly lack a bit of history class. I'm European, and the whole "Our civilization was better than their own" and also the "we should deport all of you" reaaaally sound like what the Nazis were thinking of the Jews. Also, illegal immigration is nothing like an invasion. You can't compare a huge fleet well armed and trained to drops of poor people who just want a better life. The point of the USA was to welcome immigration, check what's written below the Statue of Liberty.

The Americas would still be barren if not for the west's determination. Sadly, the American natives were thousands, if not tens of thousands, of years behind the west (likely due to the simple fact they traveled for thousands of years before settling in the Americas; & yet were still nomadic). They're more than welcome to continue chasing squirrels if they so please.	UCryYInn35ZYd3QxjaxrLcjw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCryYInn35ZYd3QxjaxrLcjw	1	UgiSgTp_C294mngCoAEC	matariki

The moral of the story is to recognize the immigrants that come here and do the work Americans wont do. It's about recognizing them as people with stories of their own and accepting and respecting them. This country was and is built on immigration and this video is trying to remind people about that and the fact that its a difficult thing. Legal immigration is a long process and not everyone can afford to take that time so sacrifices are made that put them in dangerous situations just so they can maybe have a better life.

Some get by decently, others just overstay their visas, and while as the video implies illegal immigrants work hard and it&#39;s not just the stereotypical sweat shop-type jobs, construction, and other hard labor jobs. I also have a problem with the video really presenting on Hispanics and Blacks (stereotypical illegal immigrants) and if they do show others it&#39;s a brief second. Couldn&#39;t find people from European or Asian descent to sing too? It just feels like they&#39;re focusing on one side of the story. Not showing how life has improved for illegal immigrants, I mean they wouldn&#39;t come if life was worse here than their homeland?

Well, if you really want to close our borders I hope you're ready to die in poverty at the ripe old age of 66. Or just work until you die. Because without the influx to the population we get from immigration, there won't be a workforce big enough to sustain Social Security. also, I'm not sure if you notices, but the jobs immigrants tend to get aren't the jobs Americans want. Sweat shop labor? Picking Avacados? Cleaning Sewers? You want your kids to do this shit? No. And neither do they. But it's the jobs they can get so they too can build a better life for their kids. And if that means that our economy has to adapt then that's what it always had to do. Furthermore, if it means more competition and color in traditionally professional fields in the next two generations, then good. Because increased competition leads to better quality goods and services. Finally, the only people who have any right to be upset about immigrants coming to America are the Native Americans. The rest of us got here on a boat, a plane, a raft, whatever. and we came here to pursue a better life. telling immigrants to go home is spitting all over the very thing that makes America so unique and so great. We are a melting pot of culture and background.	UCo6zc5Lac115FN3jyTyRlSQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCo6zc5Lac115FN3jyTyRlSQ	1	UghJwwnRPaZdZ3gCoAEC	Meghan Robertshaw

Ugh4CNE5KQY21XgCoAEC	0	7	2017-06-29 22:32:21	CLHB90	I&#39;m reading the comments and all I can think about is: BUT WE ARE ALL IMMIGRANTS. <br />Some at present time, some of generations back, some will be in the future. Just look at your family ancestry and you&#39;ll probaby find family members (maybe even grandparents or parents) that immigrated from somewhere else. War, poverty and all around shitty country situations are happening all the time, it just depends which country is under fire/more exposed at certain time. At the moment we are reading about Muslims in Europe and Latins in USA. But what about decades ago? WW1, WW2 and The Breakup of Yugoslavia (I&#39;m naming European situations, but I bet USA had it&#39;s fair share of migrations). What I&#39;m trying to say is that for now, most people in &quot;developed democratic countries&quot; have it good, but you never know how things will turn and maybe you&#39;ll be in their shoes, in a role of an immigrant. World is in a costant state of confrontation, everything is moving and changing every day so don&#39;t discard the possibility of you being where they were/are. Also I&#39;m talking about people who come into a foreign country just because they want a better life and a chance to live (and these are the people that this song is talking about-at least for me), and not about ill-intentioned people. And just like the song is saying and showing, immigrants do jobs that no official citizen will do (in our county we have construction workers from Balkan, who work 12 hours a day, 6 days a week, in every weather, no save work invironment, and for low pay check -if they even get one), I know for a fact that most of us in our country, would never work that hard for that little, so you see how most of them are not really stealing your jobs, since you don&#39;t even want to do them in the first place?

If we don&#39;t get a handle on both legal and illegal immigration into the US we will be looking at a population of greater than 1 billion by the year 2100. Almost 2 billion by 2150! That&#39;s six and a half times the number of people here now. 6.5 times more people means more cars, more strip malls, more infrastructure, more land for farming to feed them. In short more of Mother Nature destroyed. Gone forever. Why is that so hard to understand? Why are you so intent on destroying this country&#39;s eco-system?<br />Legal immigration must get back to the pre 1970 number of 250,000 per annum and illegal immigration must be stopped altogether if we are going to keep the nation&#39;s population below 650,000.<br />Stop destroying Mother Nature and the environment!

I have a problem with the video and I scored a damn 48 on the buzzfeed privileged test. So take several seats, bitch. This video gives off an overly aggressive vibe as to say "ka pow! fuck you white people!". my great great grandfather on my mothers mom's side came to America from Ireland and worked his but off while living in the FUCKING bronx. My grandfather on my dad's side (who I never once met in my life) grew up in a family of traveling musicians. His family's only source of income was in the shows they did. My dad got fucked over by my mom and lost his job so now he lives in an apartment and works at a gas station working his ass off to get a degree. And me? Im working at a TACKLE SHOP 6 days a week for less than minimum wage while my other friends spend their summer vacations living it up and relaxing. So I think I know what it is to have to work. But I'm white, so fuck me, right? Stfu get off your high horse, bitch. Do you forget the actual race and ethnicities of Alexander Hamilton and Laffayette?

Of course they exist and it's disgusting seeing them grouped together with the people who actually worked their asses off. Citizenship can go on for decades. My friends mother took her two decades to get her papers. And this nation, needs immigrants. Because they're making our streets, our buildings, providing our food, and so much more. That doesn't mean I'm okay with illegal immigration. But the system is whack man, a majority of us just want to work our asses and gain a better future than in their origin country. But it can take years and cost a fortune in order to complete the path to citizenship and even for a visa.

I really feel for those who come in illegally bc more than likely they are running away from something dangerous in their former country and the original place they were at is so poor, they probably had no idea there was a process to begin with; or simply the fact the illegal immigrant didn't have enough money to renew their visa.

What, you think the only law they broke is staying here illegally? How do you think they collect welfare, social security, or sometimes pay taxes when they are illegal? by STEALING people's social security number and identity, or do you think they just make up some random name and number and the government just goes "ok"...

Where is the common sense in this comment section? Half the world is living in poverty. Should the US take everyone, it will turn into another poverty country. Why not fix the problem in those countries in the first place? Everyone defending illegal people is doing it without actually thinking about it. Earth ain't so simple, there are millions of sick people that will exploit every possibility. Emotions shouldn't be your main judge for this. Use logic mostly, but I'm not saying no emotion, we need sympathy and morale. Reality is different than fantasy.

Not to mention the crime that takes place in these areas. And just so you know. Not all imagrants are hardworking, some are lazy dirty bums that don't give a fuck about anything. Don't get me wrong, there are lots of nice, hardworking people out there. But just don't generalize them like they do not wrong. There is plenty of wrong. I'm not against immigration, but illegal immigration yes. Because criminals and lazy bums cross that border illegally and not just hardworking people like you make it seem.

Thievery, rape, murder, barbarity. Who built the white house? Slaves did. <br /><br />Who built Southern affluence and Northern industrial wealth? Black people. <br /><br />On whose land did they build it? Native Americans. <br /><br />Who built the railroads? Chinese immigrants. <br /><br />Who ran farms in California? Japanese immigrants. <br /><br />Who forms the backbone of America&#39;s entire agricultural sector? Latin-American immigrants.<br /><br />And who&#39;s stolen from all of them?

Our Politicians who are complicit with lawlessness, calling for sanctuary cities, will need to face consequences for violating federal law. Exploitation is happening to those here unlawfully, no question. These people are kept in a perpetual cycle of no status in U.S. , in exchange for looking other way and not enforcing the law. This is too big for U.S. alone to handle. Countries must rebuild and thrive so citizens stay rather than flee. We are all entitled to a higher standard and quality of life; it stands to reason, our given countries provide this to us. Automatically those who don&#39;t share popular view is labeled racist etc. Nothing can be further from truth. This country owes&amp; is indebted to lawful, U.S. Citizens &amp; Residents.

The situation in the US just isn&#39;t comparible. Also, the EU now admits that the vast majority of so-called refugees are in fact economic migrants. And yet the very same people repeating that myth are the ones calling other more critical people ignorant. Time to get their facts straight. The American immigration problem isn&#39;t anywhere near the same as the one in Europe. Just blaming it on racism is extremely ignorant of the political, economical and especially social reality of modern day Europe.

Why would you let in people who despise how western women dress. Why would you let in more people damaging the minorities already in this country, 50 Percent of Black people are jobless and don&#39;t get started on how the government Destroyed thier family values, 35 percent of Latinos are jobless and 33 percent of whites are jobless you honestly think letting in people who get paid in lower wage which thier who are basically slaves for the government will help the Americans already in this country.<br /> I didn&#39;t vote Trump or Hillary but I must say as a Hispanic in New Mexico I can&#39;t help but feel an emotion of pleasure as I see wet backs being deported and Muslims going back to a death sentence in the middle East. <br /> Plus generation z Voted Extremely conservative in this Election why??

When you're an illegal immigrant you can't exactly complain to the government that you're being paid half of the minimum wage. So when selfish companies can, they will take a desperate situation and use it so they don't have to pay them as much as a legal worker. If it was made easier for immigrants to get into America you wouldn't have jobs stolen at all.

There is no such as illegal immigrants or legal immigrants rather selfishness has taken root in human society as a whole. The colonialists were not invited to Africa less than 80 years ago but they came and plundered resources, killed millions of Africans and destroyed their culture in the name of civilization! Now the same people try to go to Europe and the first world in search of better livelihoods or simply education/ knowledge without evil intentions to kill, steal, rob and plunder resources but suddenly they become illegal people?

People come here because of the dangers that's happening to their country. There is some wrong with the legal immigration system. It's takes too long for a person to come here. With for example, a war going on, they have try to find a save place, where their family can live and be save. Honestly if it didn't take 15 years for the papers to get done more people would have come here legally.

The US already has issues with unemployment and low wages. Flooding the country with new citisens that will only compete with existing citisens for jobs is not beneficial for society. A person in their late 50s who doesn&#39;t have any degrees or trade certifcations, doesn&#39;t speak English, and has a criminal record is probably not going to have a positive impact on the country that allows them to immigrate. A person in their early 30s with a medical degree, who speaks fluent English, and has no criminal record is definitely going to have a positive impact on the country that allows them to immigrate. These are obviously extreme cases, but they highlight that not every immigrant is the same, and they can&#39;t be treated the same. There are plenty of great immigrants who should definitely be accepted into the US, but there are also plenty of bad immigrants. We can&#39;t just say that all immigrants should be allowed in if they want. We also have to accept that illegal immigrants who knowingly violated federal law to enter the US should be deported. They shouldn&#39;t be allowed to stay here, they do not provide a benefit to a government that already has a massive issue with a population that refuses to pay taxes due to arrogant misconceptions of the American Revolution. Immigrants don&#39;t steal jobs, but large influxes to a country&#39;s population does cause an over saturation of the job market and leads to increased unemployment and lower wages.<br />Now let&#39;s move on to refugees. Innocent people fleeing warzones deserve help. The problem is that not only are refugees supposed to claim asylum in the first safe country they arrive in after leaving the country in which they are fleeing, meaning that almost all of the refugees in Europe should be in Turkey or Greece, but that you must actually be fleeing an unsafe country in order to be a refugee. A lot of the people claiming refugee status are actually from countries that the UNHCR would classify as safe. These people are not fleeing conflict or disaster, but are instead attempting to get a free pass into Europe so that they may receive better economic opportunity. These people are not refugees, but are in fact migrants, and should be forcibly deported back to their country of origin in accordance with the 1951 Refugee Convention. It is also important to note that refugees are only guaranteed temporary residence in the country that accepts them, and should be returned to their country of origin once the reason for their leaving is gone. Refugees are not necessarily citisens, they must be given the same rights and privileges as citisens, but they are also expected to be held to the same legal standards as citisens. All laws of the country in which they reside are applicable to them, and they cannot plead ignorance unless they can prove that information of laws that are applicable to the crimes that they have been accused of was not reasonably available. I would also like to point out that Turkey has not only violated the first safe country article by knowingly allowing refugees to pass through their country as political blackmail to the EU, but have also not provided documentation for these refugees, and has consequently exacerbated the problem of migrants posing as refugees by making it nearly impossible to definitively prove a refugee claimants country of origin.<br />Not all immigrants are equal, and it is important to understand that while a closed border policy is obviously unfair and unsustainable, but that conversely an open border policy is both dangerous and even less sustainable than the former. Everyone should be given the chance to immigrate to the country of their choosing, but that doesn&#39;t mean that country needs to accept them. We also need to remember that just because someone is a refugee doesn&#39;t give them a free pass to do whatever they want wherever they want. There are rules governing these things that a wide array of very intelligent people have accepted to benefit all parties involved. Countries must accept legitimate refugees who can prove their status, but those refugees must follow the laws of the country that accepts them, and must share a mutual respect with the people who populate that country. Everything is about balance, and every person needs to be judged on their own merits. Being a member of a group can only get you so far.

Even if you are a legal immigrant in America, you can be treated with great disrespect simply because of your accent, clothes, or color. I hope this video brings awareness the plight of all immigrants seeking solace in all countries of the world. To all who cannot wrap their minds around the worldview and perspective of others, please try to see that this video was meant to bring awareness to the situation and the cause. Not only that but if you&#39;re complaining about how illegal immigrants suck and whatnot, why don&#39;t you open your eyes and realize that it&#39;s the corporations that hire immigrants for cheap and that it&#39;s the fault of the cheapskate corporations that are preying on desperate people trying to escape their terrible circumstances.

So if Donald is gonna deporst the immagrants he has deport himself his family and every single person in America. But one race. The Native Americans. They are the true Americans and for Donald to deport immagrants. He should deport everyone who isn&#39;t Native American. But now we have to be honest. The only true race is the HUMAN RACE. And if we want to keep that race alive we need to come together and stop the wars. Because the human race is the real race.

And if you didn&#39;t have all your papers checked you were send back or imprisoned. Not sent to some box office for you to re-try. There was no re-try, there was no maybe next year. It was life or death back then. Now we have hundreds of immigration offices we have millions of dollars invested into helping new people come into our countries. Your an idiot if you think immigrants today are anything like immigrants hundreds of years ago. Us old generations moved into a land of nothing and we build this nation.

All we do everyday is to work hard and even harder, to be a good society member and to contribute more. We wait day by day, hoping to get the green card and our freedom back with it. So we wait another day, and another day, until we are too old to fight or work, we realize we have devoted our whole life to this country, but the country doesn&#39;t love us back, at least lots of people don&#39;t like us.<br /><br />Speaking of this, why is segregation still a thing in 21st century, in this so-called &quot;the greatest&quot; country where everything is possible, and you can fight for your dream?

Personally, immigrants refer to anyone and everyone; we are immigrants to this earth after it was habitable. If we can&#39;t see the difference between ourselves and animals, then I would say let the animal kingdom be deciding what happens, not the humans. I have to say that humans have degraded in intellectual knowledge ever since the &quot;god theory&quot; popped up, saying that a person&#39;s thoughts is the act of &quot;god&quot;.<br />Summary- God doesn&#39;t exist, Christians are gullible, and animals have better ways of communication than humans.

Why try to appropriate stuff tbh.<br />- Immigration is good especially during the development period of a country, however to the point of illegal immigrants explain to me how it is fair to legal immigrants who came through the lengthy legal process and to the poor jobless Americans in rural areas or the ghettos. Actually, explain it to them.<br />Once a country is developed it needs to care for the people inside its borders, there are enough Americans in need, you don&#39;t need more people to take care of if you can&#39;t already take care of the ones you have.<br /><br />+basic economics regardings minimum wages, the job market, and social programs.

We had no money or friends, didn&#39;t know the language, yet we managed to do everything legally and now we are proud US citizens. So it is possible to become legal immigrant even if you have little to no money and you are an outsider with no help.

But really, immigrants are important to a society, when it&#39;s a good dose. The Central Americans are coming to America because both their economy and government are failing them, and instead of trying to make things better they&#39;ll go to a place where everything&#39;s established, by any means. Most people will cry over these &quot;struggles&quot; but it won&#39;t change the fact that this world is cruel and the people who work for their place on Earth know what they&#39;ve done. We need to start making why are these people immigrating instead of how we can make it easier to immigrate.	UCOSZ3_uAFDYBsBi1UhV3jMw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOSZ3_uAFDYBsBi1UhV3jMw	0

If there&#39;s a group you want to take your anger out on, it&#39;s the aristocrats who want to fuck over the system for their own personal gain. and to the whole &quot;stealing jobs&quot; mentality, farms and factories are always wanting people, but are people wanting the brutal hours and physical pain. quit being lazy and work hard for once in your pussy ass life.

It&#39;s weird, cause our Nation(of my nation idk)¬†was built by immigrants, and they&#39;ve done alot to further this nation, so why wouldn&#39;t we just take them in? If no one else wants them or their to scared (with probably good reason) to stay where they are, why not take them and support them, then watch as the flourish and contribute wonderful ideas. Anyone can do it, it doesn&#39;t all have to be white guys making ideas. Actually, I think the TV was invented by a Mexican inventor, which is awesome! I want more cool stuff like that, and I don&#39;t care who makes it so long as we can all support this person. <br />Ah, this is a huge rant that i&#39;m sure i&#39;ll regret cause I said something to offend someone but, for now, i&#39;d just like to reiderate that I&#39;d rather take these people and put them in some place safe and watch as they came up with Awesome ideas or just turned into even more awesome kinds of people!

A scoundrel may be of use to us just because he is a scoundrel.<br />-- Vladimir Ilyich Lenin<br />~<br />Give me four years to teach the children and the seed I have sown will never be uprooted.<br />-- Vladimir Ilyich Lenin<br /><br />Destroy the family, you destroy the country.<br />-- Vladimir Ilyich Lenin<br /><br />The way to crush the bourgeoisie is to grind them between the millstones of taxation and inflation.<br />-- Vladimir Ilyich Lenin<br /><br />It is true that liberty is precious; so precious that it must be carefully rationed.<br />-- Vladimir Ilyich Lenin<br /><br /><br />We do not have time to play at ‚Äúoppositions‚Äù at ‚Äúconferences.‚Äù We will keep our political opponents‚Ä¶ whether open or disguised as ‚Äúnonparty,‚Äù in prison.<br />-- Vladimir Ilyich Lenin<br /><br />One of the basic conditions for the victory of socialism is the arming of the workers and the disarming of the bourgeoisie (the middle class).<br />-- Vladimir Ilyich Lenin<br /><br />One man with a gun can control 100 without one.<br />-- Vladimir Ilyich Lenin<br /><br />A system of licensing and registration is the perfect device to deny gun ownership to the bourgeoisie.<br />-- Vladimir Ilyich Lenin<br /><br />Freedom in capitalist society always remains about the same as it was in ancient Greek republics: Freedom for slave owners.<br />-- Vladimir Ilyich Lenin<br /><br />The bourgeoisie is many times stronger than we. To give it the weapon of freedom of the press is to ease the enemy‚Äôs cause, to help the class enemy. We do not desire to end in suicide, so we will not do this.<br />-- Vladimir Ilyich Lenin<br /><br />All our lives we fought against exalting the individual, against the elevation of the single person, and long ago we were over and done with the business of a hero, and here it comes up again: the glorification of one personality.

All this bullshit about drugs and guns and whatever the hell else makes no sense. If anyone could point me to credible statistics that prove anything they claim I&#39;d be more likely to believe them. Not even to mention we have a tool called deportation. If these people really are criminals sure kick them out. You can&#39;t just deny people based on the fact they MIGHT do harm. Literally, anyone has the potential to do harm to this country and the people in it. People who are already here can damage this country and its people far easier than someone who&#39;s trying to immigrate here and guess what? they do.

Came here for Snow Tha Product but stayed for the whole.<br />Sometimes this form of art is the only way for another to see their perspective, so this is true art in my eyes regardless of musical taste (still dope though).<br /><br />Imagine moving to another country for love, how you&#39;d be an immigrant until you can gain your citizenship and form a life of your own, now imagine that love is a state within America and the passion to keep you moving is your family thousands of miles away. The feeling is mutual yet the tolerance is drastic. We need more forms of art like this in the world, people are too one sided and need a wake up call sometimes.

Also my family has very heavy indigenous roots and we come from tribes the have existed in the Americas long before their ancestors came around to manifest their &quot;destiny&quot;. And you can&#39;t use that as a defense at all because the same people who say that are the people who then make it impossible for it to actually be done legally. In Mexico there is a limit to the number of people that can be given Visas and it hits its max limit in about a month but that doesn&#39;t stop the government from making you file all the forms and pay all the dues only to tell you at the very end that it turns out that you couldn&#39;t even get one to begin with. People don&#39;t immigrate because they have money and can afford to go through this time after time, they immigrate in the hopes of making sure that their kids don&#39;t have to know hunger and poverty the way they did, it&#39;s the same reason your ancestors did it years ago and they were hated then just as much as you all hate us now.

I know many Natives who grew up in homes that may not even have running water or electricity, and the government or their own small government aren't doing a thing for them. They than have options to immigrate out of the rez to city areas. Some cities in the U.S.A who are close to reservations can be really rascist to Native American. I know this by experience.

Secondly, thank you for sharing your thoughts & what surely must have been hurtful memories. Your thoughtful post made excellent points & I hope people will be open-minded when reading it. Some may say, "So she's had mean things said to her. Big deal, so have I. Why should that matter to ME?!" (Sadly, this near-hostile indifference seems to be increasingly common, particularly since the election season.) My response? Because she MATTERS. Her experiences in life & in this country MATTER. NO group or person is lesser than another, PERIOD. Stephie, you have intelligence, talents, memories, skills, & knowledge that are singular to you alone that NO ONE ELSE possesses. That alone is reason enough for you to be listened to. I hope you & your family have more positive experiences than negative, Stephie. Stay strong & keep on being you because you MATTER!

Not everyone knows about his policy, and as nice as it may or may not sound, there is still injustice towards immigrants left and right because Trump has decided to toot his horn the way he has. He, in a sense, has fueled the more racist part of America who take his words and twist them to strike fear into people who are in danger of being deported simply because they're not FROM HERE. Whether you're a criminal or not, the smallest act against the law like getting a speeding ticket, which no one is excluded from getting, could lead you to being thrown back to your country. People have a right to be afraid, don't belittle anyone who is, not that I'm saying that you were.

Also I'm assuming you made your comment with respect to Trump and his infamous wall, right? Have you even read his policy on immigration? He's allowing for the people who HAVE made that journey ILLEGALLY to be vetted, he's not going around deporting people left and right like the left seems to narrate... no one needs to live in fear, unless you are a criminal, THEN you will be deported	UCjo2EyKnyqL1MmGIcOUjZLg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjo2EyKnyqL1MmGIcOUjZLg	1	UgjuTYVXRxdnengCoAEC	John Hartman

Some of them have US citizen kids and have lived long enough to identify the US as their home, and also make new rules that offer work visas to ones who really need them. Lastly, enforce the border like any other nation. This is what I think as an immigrant.	UCM-y2PG6dWffVLPP4nXUVXA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCM-y2PG6dWffVLPP4nXUVXA	0

It tries to show that all immigrants are equal regardless of status. As if people who wait in line and follow rules and laws are no different than the ones that cut corners. In fact this message is dangerous because it could creat tensions where there should and are non right now. Americans have no anger against immigrants. But it is simply unfair to legals first because it disregards them, second to the native population because it deprives them from the right to call a place home.You really have to be intellectually at 13 year old level to find this video intellectually engaging or enriching.

Stop the hate. I&#39;m in no way condoning illegal immigration. I&#39;m just saying that immigrants are what make this country function properly. they do the work other people don&#39;t want to do and sometimes for barely minimum wage and yet they work so hard each day. could we just please acknowledge those who have put blood,sweat,and tears into their work , coming from different countries, and not knowing the language spoken. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23lovethyimmigrant">#lovethyimmigrant</a>	UCTyqFwfO-921RdhZN9PzKaA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTyqFwfO-921RdhZN9PzKaA	0

Immigration is not a right that extends to non citizens, it is supposed to be used to bolster our country not sink it. Here is a really simple description for you. People are a commodity, the more people there are, the less they are worth. So wages get drug down and down until the middle class (tax payers) stops existing and then we are eating our family pets like Venezuela. We have no idea how many people are in our country, seems like the exact situation borders were made for. Halt ALL immigration, let's get a handle on things.

We came here on a plane for a better life for my sister and I instead of being so poor in Mexico. They wanted me to grow up with health care all my life, retire, and not have to worry about health, family, working when I'm old, or money. They want me to live a good life, and I hope you people can agree with me. Right now, I have a good computer, free healthcare, the fastest internet and good cell service. I consider myself pretty privileged, but I have sympathy for my neighbors. They are a family of 4 and they all live in one room because they share a house with other families. They can't even pay $50 a week for their oldest kid to go to summer camp. I hope you people understand in a good way that immigrants work really hard, I am fortunate for my mom and dad to let me have this good of a life. Don't be disgusted by immigrants, consider them as people that have hope and faith to not be oppressed, poor, and be well educated. Immigrants work so hard, an average person has about one job, an immigrant might have 3 because they are very underpaid, but if they say something the boss threatens to deport them, so they keep living and working in these horrible conditions and don't have a say.

It's only fair. If we really think about it, none of this land or ANY land belongs to anyone. It's all a concept. So, people should be able to live anywhere they want to... however, since we do have those borders, we need to do it legally.

Due to the sacrifice of leaving behind everything they knew in Mexico and coming to the United States, I was given the opportunity to go to university and contribute to this country. My dad worked his ass off all his life only to be disrespected all of his life by fucking racists. Regardless of the fact that he is a citizen he is still treated the same. I know dozens of kids who have the same experiences as me. Who are forever grateful to their parents for doing something &quot;illegal&quot; in order to give us a better life. Immigrants are the lifeblood of this country. They are what makes it beautiful.	UCY8IbNFBdZwhn5vpwZqnH7Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY8IbNFBdZwhn5vpwZqnH7Q	0

I mean we quite literally have blood on our streets every week now, they murder us for the crime of not being muslim they rape women because they are not muslim they refuse to follow our laws have their own courts and commit horrific amounts of crime just look at the stats huge amounts are open isis supporters who even have protests and yet we are still called racist and xenophobic. Tell me how many muslims mexico has taken in?? what about japan? what about brazil? what about angola??? oh that is right fuck all yet they love do demand free entry to our countries and label us racist whilst not doing anything themselves when the capital of mexico is less then 50 percent Mexican when they are crushed beneath the truck of a jihadist then they can have the right to act as they do now but only then. also you sound like you have a ego you are not appreciative to the usa in fact you claim YOU are what makes it great. I am sure the isis members here in the uk think UK is disgusting and think they are the chosen ones the ones who will make it great but that does not mean they are correct, we were a great country long before immigrants tried to replace us if Mexicans are what makes the usa so great then surely mexico is a lot greater why not go there?

The same people saying this stuff mostly white people are the ones that have parents that pay illegal immigrants to do landscaping work. Don&#39;t mix bad illegal immigrants with the ones that are here to make a living for their families that get paid 2-3$ a day. Tell me how you will live like that??

Ugjht3QEHSp6-XgCoAEC	0	3	2017-06-29 04:49:36	Spirit of Life	Even though this video is not about illegal vs. legal immigration, the former is acknowledged as a problem. What American citizens who complain don&#39;t understand is that not everyone was born with all the rights of American citizens. That applying for citizenship and a visa to even come here in the first place takes years upon years and dollars upon dollars. That sometimes, coming here illegally may save lives. Yes, illegal immigrants can kill people. But so can the citizens. The solution is not deporting all the illegal immigrants. The solution is to fix the flawed system, and offer those illegal immigrants a better chance at joining this country completely. I don&#39;t pretend to know how to come about this solution, but spouting hatred for either side will ensure the reversal of our progress.

UghYPqFmwpVj63gCoAEC	36	2153	2017-06-29 04:34:30	Eliza Foran	We&#39;re all missing the point of the video. There is no such thing as &quot;pro-illegal-immigration&quot; but there is such thing as empathy and acknowledgement of a good job. Thousands of undesirable jobs are being filled by brave men and women who want to feed their children and grow in a free, just society. I don&#39;t think anyone would let their families starve because of an outdated and ineffective citizenship process. Immigrants just want to work hard and be treated like humans. Freedom is not free. If a citizen born and raised in the US can&#39;t get a job while an immigrant who barely speaks English can, then I think the immigrant deserves the American dream as much as the citizen. The fight for freedom is ongoing... Hard-working immigrants embody the highest example of this bravery. They deserve to be heard. Listen.

As if 12 hours in a farm field is so glamorous. I did that work for a week during harvest, farmer needed more workers so the pay was awesome, but the job itself was insane on the body if not the mind.

I wish "the system" encouraged immigrants to work rather than hide in the shadows as a stigmatized minority. I believe a streamlined citizenship process would help immigrants get the credentials they need to buy land (and pay property taxes) so they wouldnt be forced to form ghettos. Even US-born citizens have trouble finding housing because no one wants to see poor people moving into their neighborhoods. It's very complicated, and there are lots of ways to address these issues without the fear and anxiety that so many Americans feel right now.

According to Pew Research, most people, especially immigrants, pay taxes and file tax returns because it puts them in good standing with the US (and is a basic civic duty). The US tax system currently encourages taxation of undocumented workers because the IRS will legally protect their identities from immigration authorities. So yes, immigrants can pay for themselves and probably more because they are often not eligible for their social security benefits, despite some of them voluntarily paying that tax as well (Thank you, workers!). There's no political agenda in giving tax-paying men and woman a voice.	UCzkGSzkBliS3onRs07ij9Yg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzkGSzkBliS3onRs07ij9Yg	1	UghYPqFmwpVj63gCoAEC	Eliza Foran

I remember last year when my Spanish teacher showed us a film about immigration, it fascinated me. I was always pro immigration both illegal and legal but this changed how I saw immigrants. They work harder than most Americans and some Americans ( gop members) don&#39;t get that. When I told my dad ( a Republican), he flipped. He said I was being &quot;influenced&quot; by liberal media and that Trump is right about immigration. What I&#39;m saying is Immigrants have a reason to cross the border. They don&#39;t just come to &quot;steal our jobs&quot;. They come to get a better life for them and for their families. A lot get sent back home because they get caught. A lot die anyway crossing the desert. A wall is only going to cause more problems.	UCx7FDhN5btO1AZZ9vgCCDeQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCx7FDhN5btO1AZZ9vgCCDeQ	0

But did he actually DO anything for the country....fuck no he is just a man like you or me. So why is it a giant deal that people are being deported? They broke the law under Trump its what many people and the electoral college voted for... I understand innocent people are being sent back to their countries but it's what has been deemed by the federal government so this must happen. Mexico has huge problems and I understand why people see America as this place where people can go to learn the language as they work. And I know that fruit pickers and other people who come legal are abused by their contractors because they have nothing else to fall back on but that's the way that we do... our two country's have had two completely different experiences with the modern age... this type of shit was bound to happen. America belongs to American's.. if the federal government said that jumping through a hoop made of fire on a motorcycle after downing a six pack of Red Bull than you have to do it. Otherwise the Government might invest millions of dollars into find, arrest and send you back. Mexican's are pretty much fucked, "oh this is exactly what happened to the Irish" yea... that's probably the point. American's have a culture of "Hey lets go fuck with the new guy" it's just Mexico is so fucked up that Mexicans are the perpetual new guy.

No one other than the disgusting KKK is against immigration. The right is against illegal immigration and unsafe immigration. People who come into the country through the legal way rather than undermining the law are welcome. Furthermore, the people most fucked over by illegal immigration are the legal immigrants. Secondly, refugees are more than welcome so long as we can bring them into our arms in a safe manner that is less likely to result in piles of dead Americans. <br />Liberals, please listen, we don&#39;t have people who aren&#39;t American, we just want to do this in a smart, calculated, and safe way. I understand that your sympathy and sentiment is the root of your desire to open the flood gates, but please try to understand our perspective as well. <br />Those who truly hate immigrants because of their race are in a severely small minority. Don&#39;t paint all of us like that.	UC0qCwagEBNgNiWKJrTl4Gug	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0qCwagEBNgNiWKJrTl4Gug	0

Then there&#39;s the fact that it implies that there is some sort of witch hunt for immigrants from war torn and poverty stricken countries, this is simply not true. All immigrants should be legalized first but the main point of legal immigration especially from war torn Middle Eastern countries is weeding out the terrorists.

I'm on 10th grade, I'm legal but I'm working on McDonald's at mornings and the afternoon I can work on FedEx cleaning the company with my uncles. Did u or ur family eat strawberries or oranges? Did u went to pay a McDonald's meal and someone just gave ur order? Did u went to companies like FedEx, Walmart or other and u see the floor is clean at the mornin?

I have seen illegal immigrants suffer the hard life trying to get citizenship, a good job, home, etc. Of course there&#39;s going to be many suffering these obstacles BUT so is ordinary Americans. The majority of people that suffer poverty, hunger, and debt are WHITE Americans citizens. (Over 40%) And PLEASE stop bringing up the fact &quot;America was founded by illegal immigrants&quot; because it WASN&#39;T. Before we got to the western world, Native Americans were still fighting each other for land territory, there wasn&#39;t America until we fought them and made it. Finally, why do everyone think Americans are savages who killed off Native Americans? The majority of them died due to disease and back then, no one had control over that!

Everybody in the U.S. knows and has always known that a certain set of companies and professions use illegal immigrants as their primary labor force--in order to pay lower wages and skirt labor laws. Republicans have always supported this because they thought it was more free market, and because the factory owners, growers, and other companies doing the hiring are big Republican contributors.<br /><br />If you want to stop this, then punish the cause, the companies hiring and recruiting these folks to come up here, instead of using the illegal immigration issue as an excuse to insult and attack people who &quot;look different&quot;. Because as long as a packing plant is looking to fill up it&#39;s floor with underpaid and overworked illegal immigrants, there will always be poor, hard-working, ambitious people willing to risk deportation if it means they might be able to give themselves and their families a better life.<br /><br />Take a step back illegally entering a country is hardly murder. Underage drinking is also &quot;law breaking&quot;. Moreover, immigrants are significantly more law-abiding than the average American (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/us/trump-illegal-immigrants-crime.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/us/trump-illegal-immigrants-crime.html</a>).

I think that in some ways the phrase "best country" or "better country" is partially subjective. It's pointless to think that there are better countries than some, because we think so broadly on good and bad countries. Yes the U.S, Canada, UK, etc are good countries, but I don't think we give it enough thought as to which one of these good countries is better than another, if it's even possible for one to be better. I feel what i'm arguing is useless to argue about because of what I just said, saying one country is better than the other is subjective. It may not be subjective, but it's the smallest things in that country that could make it better than another.

Now it includes a bunch of entitled lazy people demanding their American dream. America was founded by immigrants but now that it's established, "WE" need to protect it against diverting interests.

The ones who leave foreign countries legally are the movers and shakers with the intellect and means to make a difference in their home country. By drawing them here you deprive that nation of the brainpower that would revive their dying country. YOU need to grow up because your pro-immigration policy is causing 3rd world countries to remain 3rd world countries.

I would definitely agree that a large majority of immigrants are good people who just want personal safety and better economic opportunities. The problem is the idea that we shouldn't discriminate between immigrants for any reason. That we should treat a hard working respectful person who wants to benefit society the same as a lazy mooch who just wants to live off society. There is a reason people need to fill out paperwork before they can enter the US. Does it take far too long for people to have their application processed? Definitely. Does it cost too much money to complete the entire process? Without a doubt. Does that mean we should scrap the whole system and just give everyone who crosses the border immediate US citisenship?

Legal immigrants are welcomed so long as they will contribute to our society and benefit the economy (Due to the presence of a welfare state). One of the major issues I find is that there is not a substantial delineation made between those who migrate to this country Legally and those who come here Illegally (Not excluding those who overstay visas).

I'm sure there are other things contributing, but in my experience those are the two biggest. 100 years ago people from Germany, Ireland, Spain, Italy, etc. weren't considered "true" whites. They were "ethnic whites"- a group considered inferior to the "true" whites- mainly English and French people. Over the years that has gone away, but back then the ethnic whites were subjected to similar racist attacks over their supposed inferiority.

First Nations peoples had established large cities, nations, trade routes, treaties and accords with their neighbors, and much more civilization than the europeans brought with them thousands of years before their arrival. some of the founding documents of this country were directly taken from theirs, and the iroquois league of nations helped inspire the model for the early ideas of uniting the states into a new country. Neither this land nor its people were 'savage', there were already established civilizations with cities, countries and nations, cultures, technologies, laws, religions and mythologies, and so much more in place before the first europeans set foot on the soil that would become america. The only reason they were ever called that was as an insult by europeans, who even called the french that at the time, and everyone else they didn't like when the mood suited them to make themselves feel superior to the people they intended to supplant and conquer.

But keep feeling morally superior supporting mass immigration, when all the wealth earned from an endless stream of gov't-subsidized cheap labor all goes to the top. You all want to talk about the "top whatever percent" and how well they're doing, but you dare not broach the subject of mass immigration. You want your future low-info Democrat voters, right?

Those are true, uninformed, uneducated racists... This sheer problem sought its solution long before middle ages, all around the world. White people did what everybody did then. Blacks, browns, yellows, reds, whites, light-browns, and all the colors in the world - they sought freedom and conquered lands in, yes, malevolent ways - those were the times it happened like it was normal for everobody, no matter which race. People who suddenly woke up today, talking and shouting that white people invented slavery and conquer, they are utter idiots who you should never even speak to, EVER. Just turn around and run away as fast as you can from them, because those same people will stab you in your back if they get even the slightest opportunity to get rich. If you don't understnad the logic behind it, you should suck on your own dick, because you're too stupid to get the memo.

Native Americans were here first, and the Europeans killed them off with disease and the steel of their blades. It's infuriating and utterly malevolent that they think their Manifest Destiny was the one, true way of civilization. I love this video. It's thought-provoking and heart-wrenching. Racism in the states doesn't help any immigrant at all because whether they're a bum or not, everyone assumes that you are unless you make yourself act more "civilized". The next time someone sees a POC in a lowly-ranked job, they'll think twice hopefully. Everyone has a story, and sometimes, the only reason why they can't rise up to take their shot is that no one steps up to allow them that opportunity. It's closed-minded people that stop the success of America. It's closed-minded people that *prevent* the success of the entire world. Lin, you've done a fantastic job with this, and I'm so proud.

I was born from a immigrant family as an American. They entered legally, got work visas and eventually got citizenships. The reason immigrants are taking jobs is because of the low wage they are given. I believe they should be given a easier way to citizenship or work visa. Legally. Because once that happens, they will have to pay taxes, and be subjected to the nationality of an American. Because really, how would you justify illegally crossing the border if you could&#39;ve just legally applied for citizenship with not that much more effort.

For starters, the colonists came to settle a land without any organized government. Not to justify their treatment of natives, but saying they did the same thing isn&#39;t true. Not only that, but times have changed. <br /><br />The United States is one government and, like any nation, has laws to be followed. Lets compare two countries with seperate ideas on immigration. <br /><br />Canada, a country considered to be a very open place, has a much stricter immigration policy than the US. From some base level research, I&#39;ve found that Canada has only had about 6 or 7 notable terrorist attacks in the past decade. <br /><br />France, a country significantly smaller in size and population, has had over 20 terrorist attacks in the same time span. That&#39;s 3 times the amount.<br /><br />The logical counter argument would be that France is closer to areas from which terrorist organization would thrive from, but even still, there shouldnt be that high of an increase. France isnt even the most open bordered country out there, and you could probably find similar amounts of attacks in places like the UK or Sweden or Germany. <br /><br />Simply put, from statistical evidence, more open borders will undoubtedly lead to more terrorist attacks. I&#39;m not saying we should turn away refugees, but all these vetting procedures and checks are a neccessary precaution to keep people safe.

Hopefully one day the government will agree. My mom used to work at a private school in Houston before I was born, and since she&#39;s fluent in Spanish, she became very good friends with the lunch ladies who were from Mexico and spoke barely any English. After them having been friends with my mom for a long time, they ended up telling her that they were illegal, and terrified that their children were going to be taken from them / deported back to Mexico. When my mom asked them why they were illegal, they said that the lawyer they hired to deal with their documents was actually a criminal lawyer who ended up stealing all of their information and money and left them stranded in the US without any documentation or licensing. And as it turns out, this is a very serious problem in Mexico. You see, not all illegal immigrants are criminals at all; they, in actuality, got conned by a criminal and are in serious need of help. Despite not doing anything wrong and trying to arrive in America legally, the government doesn&#39;t see that. They just go after any and all illegals, bunching them up under one label: &quot;criminal&quot;. It&#39;s entirely unfair. Hope this sheds some light on the situation for some of you.

And the same can be said with black people. But back to the racism, stop saying white people are privileged and are evil because we aren&#39;t. Sure there are a few privileged white people, but comparing that to families who have to work their butts off just to keep up with rent. And when you call us all racist, it doesn&#39;t make it better. The more you push this &quot;white people are all racists,&quot; the more the people will become what you sow.

Now I'm not saying that all white people are racist or that they are all rich, but why should white people being poor be our excuse for not letting immigrants in? So because some don't what immigrants in our country we are going to start focusing on people in our country? Because that's really low.

UghXIRyXCh-GrngCoAEC	0	1	2017-06-29 02:51:49	Boss Galka	We came here illegally and stole land from Native Americans. That was wrong. Our nation was founded on bullshit, don&#39;t pretend like we are all good people who came here with good intentions and open arms. The British people, the Irish, The African-Americans, the Chinese etc. all hated each other and didn&#39;t want each other here. It was just ungoverned land, and you could come here and do whatever the fuck you want, that is why we all rushed here hundreds and hundreds of years ago. If the native Americans already had a country formed with a government it would have been a hell of a lot different and they wouldn&#39;t have wanted us to come here, and sure as hell wouldn&#39;t do it with open arms.<br /><br />We now have an established government, we are a real country, one of the biggest and a linchpin in the world economy. We also have many enemies. We CAN NOT and SHOULD NOT allow ILLEGAL, UNDOCUMENTED peoples into the country period. Anyone who disagrees is an absolute idiot that should educate themselves on how the world works and never hold office or any decision making power for the country ever. It&#39;s fine if you want to rework the immigration system, it does suck that it takes us so long to document and allow people in, but we don&#39;t NEED more immigrants, it&#39;s not a business, and letting in a swarm of them wouldn&#39;t be worth the extra money and man-power required to safely vet an increased number of immigrants in each year. If anything, we might be able to let more in and need more IF illegal ones stopped coming in and taking over the roles of what legal ones might take.<br /><br />Sure, it&#39;s sad that they just want a better life, but America isn&#39;t the bad guy here. And sure, a lot of the people that don&#39;t want them here are just as uneducated as you who do want them here, but the bottom line is they are illegal, and having illegal immigrants in our country is only a negative to us. We aren&#39;t a charity and it&#39;s not our job to hurt ourselves in order to make life better for other people. If you truly think they should be allowed to come in swarms and we should welcome them with open arms, just look at that horrible mess in Europe as an example right now. It&#39;s not going well over there.	UCzoy6o4xE9V8AI2EaS_auXw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzoy6o4xE9V8AI2EaS_auXw	0

But it's pretty easy to hate a narcissistic, misogynistic, ignorant, trust fund baby that tries to suddenly act like he's the people's champ. Many politicians are like this sure, but they way he craves attention and goes out of his way to misrepresent how little he actually cares about working people is what really rubs others the wrong way. The man isn't a Republican or a Democrat, he's an opportunist. He has no real convictions or values and if you pay attention to anything he says it is usually factually incorrect or just childishly unrealistic. Seriously just read his twitter feed and try to make sense of any of the things he claims he does. Or decipher the inane rants he goes on. I'm not cool with any elected official to needlessly spend a community's money for his own benefit. The man is an ass. If he was a rich asshat who used his own money...whatever his life his problem. But he's now potentially got the power to affect people's lives on a whim. But doesn't seem to have the mental capacity or at least the empathy to realize this. Ask the residents around Mar-a-lago (who came up with this stupid name anyway?) what the bills he's racking up could be doing to improve their community instead of just paying for his gold outings. What had he accomplished in half a year after all that talk? It shouldn't be about dick-riding about one party or the other. People need to make their own conclusions.

People in the comments say they need stay in their country and help their own, other people say it&#39;s propaganda and others say they should come in and do it the legal way. <br />I say you don&#39;t know how hard it is to register, you don&#39;t know how bad it is in ones country. Until you have walked a mile in ones shoes, you will never know. Now being propaganda, it isn&#39;t propaganda! People say we need to keep the immigrants out. Well we are the ones that welcomed them in. It&#39;s says on the Statue of Liberty &quot;give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to be free&quot; <br />If we don&#39;t start to adhere to those words, then maybe we should take down the Statue of Liberty. Again to recap. Don&#39;t judge until you know their pain. Don&#39;t judge anyone. The United States as a whole was built by Immigrants for immigrants! the only ones that really got the short end of the stick are Native Americans. And we still try to help.

My uncle was denied access to even having a meeting about a visa even though he has family (me and a dozen other members) in the US just because they thought he wasn't married to his wife (despite having documents and everything). We deny people access over stupid and trivial stuff so no wonder people resort to illegal immigration. Face it bud, without illegal immigration our economy would be put off by millions of dollars.

They came just like everyone else. They also stole land from each other and slaughtered each other like every other group of people in history. When the Europeans came over, they were not illegal either. There was no nation with official laws created to govern the entry of people into the land. Therefore, it was impossible to be illegal moron. Also, the Natives sold most of the land to Europeans. Yes, some was stolen, just like land has been stolen by people for all of history if they were weaker than the attacking group. Yet, despite every group doing it, and most doing it far more viciously, you only seem to care about when white people do it. So in other words you are just racist scum!

Hey, didn't the early Americans come to North America and steal the land from the native Americans? Hey, isn't the epoch of American slavery a unique case of slavery in that black people were not only enslaved but dehumanized? Remember that? Hey, didn't the Americans in the from the late 1890s to the 1940s decide to join the Let's-conquer-everything vibe and decide to "fight" for the freedom of their "Filipino Brothers?" Oh, that went well. You bought our country from Spain and mooched off of our resources, saying that the Philippines was a strategic location in the Pacific. A war was fought and you won, of course. You planted propaganda teachers (google the Thomasites) and taught that you were "liberators." We got angry. Some Filipinos murdered about 48 US Soldiers. Deplorable. You know what you did, in retaliation? I'll let General Jacob Smith tell you: "I want no prisoners. I wish you to kill and burn; the more you kill and burn, the better it will please me... The interior of Samar must be made a howling wilderness..." And then you left us in the 40s. Only to install and support a dictator from the 70s to the 80s who killed at least 3 thousand Filipinos, subjugated journalistic freedoms and civilian freedoms, and made government officials of corporate heads at the time. Do you know who Ferdinand Marcos is? Even now my country is filled with American sexpats. You come here for sex because you can't get any in your own country, so you go to an impoverished one and promise poor girls money in exchange for sex. Because of the difference in purchasing power parity and cost of living in the US and the Philippines, these retiring sexpats can afford to live like upper-middle class people without having to run in the rat's race like the rest of the Filipinos. Which country was most heavily involved in the Gulf War? The Vietnam war? All these countries full of brown people. You put your guns there and told people you were "liberating" them. Not that you were guarding your own interests. Not that you needed Kuwait to survive so they would give America better prices for oil. And now you have the audacity to call brown people parasites?

Not only that, but it incredibly hard to become a legal citizen. They have to be able to read and write english which they probably can't do very well. They also have to stay in the us for 5 years, which is very difficult is they have family in other countries that they have to care for but cannot bring. Also, they would not destroy the nation. Most immigrants take jobs that Americans have abandoned even though they can be some of the most important because many they're 'gross' or don't pay what they want.

America tries to help other countries from terrorist and shit by also killing innocent but what about the innocent that come here to escape all of that? they get treated badly and sent back, almost the same as terrorist	UCTelaJROxQilsu5NobF9KEQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTelaJROxQilsu5NobF9KEQ	1	Ugg5TgIr3olOyngCoAEC	Tantheman93
Ugg5TgIr3olOyngCoAEC.8UNJo-3DG-n8UPcD_L1enb		3	2017-06-29 23:54:12	FPSKorea	+Emiri Kinoko Did you know that over 70% of refugees who come to Europe from the Middle East are middle-aged men who are clearly capable of strong physical activities and assault? Did you know that over 30% of Muslims worldwide support all the terrorist attacks and believes that it's justifiable? Did you know that over 90% of all illegal drugs come from Mexico, transported from other South American countries? Did you know that if illegal immigrants, as showed in this video, make products and sell them, they're clearly able to make a living in their home country? They do nothing but leech off from government benefits and welfare that *I* have to pay to get. If you think that all refugees and illegal immigrants have the right to freely come into our country and take whatever they want to have, why do you even have a front door? Shouldn't you welcome all people who want to freely come into your house and take whatever they want to take? Sit the fuck down, hypocrite fatass. +David Lombana Yes, I know where the song came from this video. It was inspired by the song "The Battle of Yorktown (The World Has Turned Upside Down)" from the internationally famous musical, Hamilton. It's pretty obvious when I've seen the musical with the original cast in Broadway myself. If you think you motherfucker has the steel balls to even remove your front door and get a huge sign that says *"YOU'RE FREE TO COME IN AND TAKE WHATEVER YOU WANT TO,"* I'll stand down because I served for 12 years in the Gulf War and the War on Afghanistan. Next, you're going to tell me that I'm an Islamophobe for serving in the military. You Liberal hypocrites don't know shit about being in danger. You bastards don't even have the responsibility to spend 30 seconds of your life re-checking your "facts." All you do is sit on the couch with your fatass, spread social justice on Tumblr, and tell people that being fat is a thing you should take pride in.

Nah you're just an ass on YouTube trying to get likes from alt-right leaning types blabbering on about CENSORSHIP (at least spell the damn word right) and illegals taking over your country...allegedly. You don't know the context of this, you probably don't like hip hop or care for any of these artists so again...why even bother to watch this? You're not the audience for this or even part of the conversation. And fpskorea wouldn't have the balls to stand up to an entire corrupt system of government and armed criminals, in bed with each other...which is usually what most refugees are fleeing form when they come to this country.

If immigrants can get the job done, why can't they do it in their own countries? Why do men from the Middle East run and hide to Europe when they can clearly fight against terrorism? Why to people in Mexico and other South American people come to the United States if they can do work and get their job done in their own country to make it better? And how this whole video is extremely misleading and propaganda-like.	UC9d0kqrAtcSmMaIg3-SSB0g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9d0kqrAtcSmMaIg3-SSB0g	1	Ugg5TgIr3olOyngCoAEC	Tantheman93

The problem is that you all assume people want to come here ILLEGALLY, no immigrant wants to risk their life crossing into another country to provide for their family. Bt they do anyways. As an act of LOVE. As a SACRIFICE. Immigrants who came here legally and belittle those who couldnt have a legal process shouldn&#39;t speak on this topic. You walked another path, an easier path. So now you&#39;re entitled to criticize??? No you&#39;re not. Instead support the Immigrant Community, legal and illegal. documented and undocumented.

What i don&#39;t like, is illegal immigrants, but reality is this american&#39;s cannot or choose not to do the things illegal immigrants do. So to that, i suggest this, tax the illegals immigrants as normal citizens and the second they commit any crime they get deported. it balances the good and the bad that come into america. also any children of illegal immigrants remain citizens of the illegal immigrants country, not the USA. a kinda look the other way type situation.

My Great Grandfather came here legally with his parents and his sister and at a very young age his parents died from the flu. Him and his sister were separated as she was adopted by another family and he stayed with his neighbor. They didn&#39;t see each other for 55 years. I also have a friend who is an immigrant from Albania who came to Philadelphia with nothing and started working as a bus boy in kitchens and eventually after 20+ years he owns multiple restaurants in Philadelphia and the Jersey Shore. There&#39;s a difference between these people and illegals who didn&#39;t have to go through the hard work to become a citizen and work their way up in the world, who don&#39;t pay taxes, and are destroying America.

They want a better life, and America has offered that type of life for them. But some people have to understand, the law is the law. The law has no feelings, it just rules what is wrong and what is right. The law is harsh. Legal immigrants came a long way, they work immensely hard (rip my english). Illegal immigrants work their heads off too, but they are still illegal. Its really hard for immigrants from war torn countries and countries altogether to get a citizenship. Note that it takes about 10 hears or so. But being illegal still makes it hard and you cant reap all the benefits of being in the US. Being illegal is also hard because of many risks, like deportation. Illegal immigrants also make the economy a bit of a hassle too. America cant just take in all illegal immigrants and having to use programs to support these people is difficult and may make the economy situation worse. (Ive tried my best to be completely unbiased in any way possible. I don&#39;t really support any politician either) It breaks my heart when families get separated because of this. I want to help, but I dont know how. But this is my point. Illegal is still illegal.	UCVt93GMxlJjQvy6LKij0mgA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVt93GMxlJjQvy6LKij0mgA	0

Usually it&#39;s illegals and refugees. I don&#39;t have a problem with that. If keeping them out means me and the millions of people around me get a chance at pursuing happiness then so be it. Freedom is gained by unfairness. If we allow one thing, then we strip from others. Don&#39;t use the screams of people suffering to guilt trip others. There&#39;s all types of screams out there, even in the confines of our own country. Did we hear any of them? NO, we were too busy riding our high horse. No time for plebs, right? Disgraceful.

Most people have no problems with legal immigrants. It&#39;s the illegal ones that mess everything up. They have the benefits of taxpayers without paying taxes. It ruins the economy. Also, I would think that legal immigrants would dislike illegals the most. They know how difficult the immigration process is, so they should want everyone else to have to go through the same process as them. It&#39;s unfair that those who do the right thing suffer from those who do the wrong thing because sanctuary cities see nothing wrong with breaking the law	UCfFiW51yrfulwGGhH8aakuA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfFiW51yrfulwGGhH8aakuA	0

UgiKinJoF6YapHgCoAEC.8UNH1yjxBMa8UOgVwm3oXP		2	2017-06-29 15:12:25	TheMichigami	the truth is, starting sometime around the mid to late 70s people started getting it put into their heads that it was a bad thing to do heavy and farm labor work by popular media and culture, and that they should be paid more money for less work, so lots of people started to stop applying for those kind of jobs. Some of my cousins used to get on a bus and head south during their school breaks to pick tobacco in the early 80s, a lot of teenagers and young adults used to. Lots of people who were laid off from the mills or mines would take the train out to cali or florida to pick fruit and veggies, not as a hipster 'back to the land' tourist thing as a few people do now but as a necessity for an income and to keep food flowing to the markets. Migrant seasonal workers came in every color of the rainbow, and all got crap pay for hard work because farm labor has never been something that can afford to pay well, but things got done. That all changed slowly around the late 70's through the 80s, there was a cultural shift into the "Me"-mentality where people started to think things like farm work and mill labor were beneath them and for a lower class of people. somehow the concept that actual labor and hard work, especially if it benefited other people, was something to shame people for doing became popularized, and it's still stuck in popular culture today which is stupidity beyond words. The migrant workers of possible questionable citizenship had always been part of the group, but now with the decrease of other people willing to do the work, there were more jobs for them, almost to the point of becoming a crisis for farms over the 80's and into the early 90's because there simply were not enough workers to go around, so they began hiring anyone willing and looking the other way at certain issues because they needed the labor. suddenly, decades later, someone looked around and realized that all the college kids from ohio and nebraska were gone from the fields and all that was left were the kind of people that made them start yelling idiotic things about "stolen jobs" and the usual garbage we've all heard by now.

UgiKinJoF6YapHgCoAEC.8UNH1yjxBMa8UOEdI-Agwo		7	2017-06-29 11:00:09	Joseph Smith	Well, Frank. I can't speak for all white people (fuck your blanket racism statemrnt) but we probably wouldn't work for 12 hours a day at $8.00 an hour under those conditions. See that's the problem. Your countrymen, let's say Mexicans in this case, will accept that wage under those conditions because they know that once it's earned and sent back to their country, say Mexico in this example, they are literally earning about 143 pesos an hour, 1,716 pesos a day or roughly 10,300 pesos for a six day week. The average Mexican wage in Mexico? 330 pesos a week. The "low, ball busting wage of $8.00" an hour is actually **30 X higher** then the average weekly Mexican wage. Since most of the money made in the US is sent back to Mexico and little of it remains to be spent in the US, I don't want to hear another word about the squalid conditions you claim Illegals put themselves under to slave away from us. If anything, it has been a mutually beneficial relationship between Mexican nationals and US Big Business always trying to lkeep lower wages. So what we have in effect are hard workers willing to accept a much lower US living wage than what an American native and/or other US citizens expect. compared to what the average US worker makes, however significantly higher, by 30x,. The luxury, of course, is that in their homelands, the US dollar stretches much further. The concern then becomes inflation if everyone starts getting paid in dollars so around and around we go.

Your comment screams of privilege, it's not wrong to leave behind your birth country and move abroad for a better life and better opportunities. Many countries don't have the privileges your country has, in fact they won't for a long time because of how messed up the world is. Learn about the world around you, learn that people suffer a lot because where they're from. Don't hide behind a computer screen and make fun of these people. Why would anyone want to leave behind their home and be labelled as an alien in another country? Some of us don't even have a choice.

And they want a tax cut when they'd still have a bunch more money than anyone else has made. Middle class and lower class pays the taxes, while rich want a tax cut, and only for them.

En Miami, por ejemplo, hay unos que no hacen nada por la causa Americana. Hay otros, la mayoria honestamente, que son duenos de negocio y hacen dinero por la simple causa que se esforsaron y pensaron mas alla de simple trabajar. Pensaron con innovacion e con inteligencia. En realidad por eso es que Miami se hizo tan popular. La proxima piensa en ezo.	UC4k6EHzwOP0AhSMk8GM8ncw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4k6EHzwOP0AhSMk8GM8ncw	1	Ugi2oxnd8TPRZXgCoAEC	David Mendoza

Many Central Americans victimize themselves and demand government help rather than working their way up. There would be less famies needing help if our government didn't encourage such reliance on welfare programs. 3. Immigrants from Cuba, and yes the ones in Miami too, had and have to work their way out of government assistance. They were seeking freedom from government in Cuba, not dependancy on the U.S. government. One month welfare is okay, after that work your way up.

The point of this song and more specifically the part of the musical it originates from is to illustrate that immigrants sometimes go uncredited in history for doing extraordinary things. Unfortunately a lot of people piling on here have no clue about the musical and don't know the context...or are people born here after their predecessors already went through the immigrant experience and have no appreciation for it. No offense to all Cubans but from my time in Miami, the majority of those born here either vote strictly Republican or couldn't care less about the struggles of other immigrants since they already have their situation in order...and want to appear as assimilated as possible...putting it very lightly...you're not like the rest of us Latin American living in the US.

I love Lin for representing us so beautifully ‚ù§<br /><br />People keep dissing on illegal immigration though they don&#39;t realize at what costs people cross over to the U.S. Most people who are able to come legally are those who already have it made in their country and are seen as profitable for the country. Those crossing illegally risk their lives for a chance at a better life for themselves and their family, creating jobs for themselves which are jobs that others wouldn&#39;t take up working in harsh conditions and still paying the same taxes as everyone else which is something that many people don&#39;t realize. Though there are criminals, there are no more illegal criminals than there are citizens. This country was built off of the back of immigrants, legal and illegal. We don&#39;t live off of anyone, we are not stealing any jobs, and we only seek a better life. I am an immigrant and the daughter of immigrants who have worked hard to provide me and my brothers with a proper education and thus I am now in college and will only continue to work even harder to prove that I can be just as successful as any Citizen.

Uggvae9uzAR4hHgCoAEC	15	599	2017-06-29 01:45:03	Nancy Reyes	This might be a bit irrelevent but I find it completely hypocrytical when people defend police men shooting innocent people with the defense &quot;they feared for their lifes&quot;, yet they HATE undocumented immigrants when they cross the border without papers.... These people <b>also</b> feared for their lifes. The majority of them are persecuted in their own country or are unable to live a humane life due to factors that they cannot manipulate, yet people just CANNOT see that. So some people can kill others in &quot;self-defense&quot; and get a slap on the wrist, but god forbid that another person try and survive by crossing an imagenary border. Please tell me that I&#39;m not the only one who finds this ironic...<br /> I mean issues like these are completely ridiculous, we are literally hating on our own kind based on the amount of pigment and melanin that we are BORN with (as in we can&#39;t control it), or the longitudinal and latitudinal area in which we were born/raised. The tongue which we speak, the beliefs that we practice. All these things are what make us beautiful and unique, yet we have become ignorant to that thought. <br />Disclaimer: I do not want to start an argument with anybody 	UC5TCm-7-_gKxSYXYgHTsd-Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5TCm-7-_gKxSYXYgHTsd-Q	0

I would challenge you, who looks at the disproportionate killing of black men in the US to put yourself in the position of their mothers. Put yourself in her shoes and know that you will never see your son who was playing in the park again or who was just driving and got killed during the 43rd time he was wrongly pulled over because he looked like someone else with a "wide set" nose. Black people are targeted and put in intense, emotional situations where people are willing to kill them daily. Oh and you think drug cartels are trying to enter the US? I can't even begin to address that one - - All of your little factoids are emotional and made up. And you misused the word ironic twice.

Uggvae9uzAR4hHgCoAEC.8UNF6WgCkl58UPMujnmIzX		2	2017-06-29 21:31:41	A. Wilson	@Nancy Reyes Your comparison between law enforcement and illegal immigrants is flawed and not at all ironic. Law enforcement and illegal immigrants are completely different topics. They each have completely different circumstances. They are both under completely different pressures and face different risks. They serve different roles in society and have different responsibilities. I do find your trivialisation of either a necessary loss of life or accidental/unnecessary loss of life, by putting self defence in parenthesise, a tad sickening. Law enforcement face exceptional challenges and dangers, I would challenge any one that looks at a police shooting in hindsight to put themselves in the shoes of the officer and consider their options in that split second moment where they might not get to go home again, see their family and loved ones (and yes I know the same can be applied to the other players in that scenario but police don't set out to kill people, yet they are targeted or are put in intense, emotional situations with people are willing to kill them). Now obviously there are officers that abuse their power and to them I say fuck you. But it's a tiny proportion which I don't think is communicated in this comment by the fact you made it the sole argument for why the situation is ironic. I do believe legal immigration should be relaxed for economic issues, if people want to work then let them come and work. But borders play an important role in security. For example in America you have the cartels just over the border. While the border obviously can't stop them completely it can make their lives more difficult, which helps protect both the public and law enforcement. Obviously this is a very complicated topic and not one that I'm going to delve into (ain't nobody got time for that). I know you said you didn't want to argue (neither do I, just wanted to share my opinion on your opinion), but I hope you took the time to read this and that even if you don't agree with what I've said that you understand the points I made.

They don't file taxes to avoid being noticed, so all of the money that would be sent in a return stays in the treasury gaining interest. They pay sales taxes. They rent, which means the landlord passes on the property taxes to them. They fill a job for which there is demand, which means they generate economic activity. It's not just about taxes, rounding everybody up and shipping them out will hurt any business that has any connection to them. Immigrants do send money home, which a lot of people complain about. But it's really like foreign aid that goes to families instead of the government. Also that aid wasn't given it was earned. There is increased pressure on infrastructure, but removing that pressure won't stop the infrastructure from failing, just slow it a bit. The government is unwilling to spend money on things that every country needs. A full road system, an air traffic system, bridges, maintained damns.

Just because it's legal doesn't mean it's right. Just because it's illegal doesn't mean it's necessarily wrong. Laws change, but morals and a sense of justice, fairness and compassion sometimes means breaking the law. There's also economic issues, about which there are good points from both sides of the argument. Yes, many illegal immigrants don't pay taxes. On the other hand, they also work multiple rough, dangerous or demeaning jobs below minimum wage just to feed and clothe themselves and their dependants because as illegal immigrants, they don't have any other choice. If those jobs weren't being done, by the way, legal, taxpaying citizens would not benefit as greatly from their cheap labour. These migrants may not contribute in taxes, but they sure do contribute in labour.	UC9vL_2bbH9kMbAgbcKOgs9A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9vL_2bbH9kMbAgbcKOgs9A	1	UgjgJm1csDK47HgCoAEC	Kenny Omega

Fact of the matter is, illegal immigrants provide more tax income than they use in benefits. A larger labor market means a larger economy, and honestly, without immigration we'd be in a much worse economic situation considering our declining birth dates over the last 30-50 years. If people are worried about losing their job to an undercutter, the onus is on that individual to improve themselves and fight for their opportunity. Nothing is given, and resources exist for anyone who wants to improve.	UCsdEPFPk8Jdr_d_ziiLJo2g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsdEPFPk8Jdr_d_ziiLJo2g	1	UgjgJm1csDK47HgCoAEC	Kenny Omega

What if an immigrant comes to America to save their life? The law isn't so cut and dry, you don't blindly follow them, they're created by our society, we have the power to change them and to argue their purpose. There are a ton of really random and obscure laws people break all the time, for much less important reasons than seeking a better life, and they're not bad people and they shouldn't automatically be condemned due to a cut and dry rule. The spirit of the law exists for a reason. If your argument is," it's a law, follow it," then you're not looking at the law creation process as a whole and you're missing out on life happening around you. Being open-minded is far more important than obstinately sticking to written rules with no context.

I see a lot of people claiming that because illegal immigrants pay sales taxes that makes up for their lack of federal income tax. A legal citisen also pays sales taxes, so the average illegal immigrant is still giving less to the government than a legal citisen, which gets even worse when you realise that income tax is much higher than the total amount you would likely spend on sales taxes in a year.

Additionally, you also chose not to honor/keep any sense of where you come from due to assimilation that was "required" when many new European cultures came to the US in the early 1900's and were looked down upon from the older elitist population. For that you have my condolences because they both have wonderful history. I'm not saying anyone who doesn't see my ideas are not smart that's what you simply assumed. I'm open to many ideas/cultures and will never judge whomever by a few bad apples within their ethnicity/country.

You clinging on to your Mexican heritage is a choice, but consider that those of us that choose to claim only American heritage, including many people with Latino heritage, choose country over race every time. If you want the American dream, you'd better be prepared to give up everything, including much of your culture, to become one.

Spewing hate towards illegal Latino immigrants that only hope to find a better life from their homeland with nothing but a dream and what they can carry. Do you think they want to leave everything behind and go somewhere unfamiliar? I know that I'm an American foremost but I also pride myself in being Mexican and that my predecessor struggled to find a prosperous new life for their family. Why do people scorn me when I display my pride for my ancestral homeland while many others are revered for keeping their traditions. Not every immigrant is a drug dealer or bad person in the contrary many avoid breaking laws since they know that deportation would be their punishment. Also most of the US south west did belong to Mexico until they were forced to "sell" it to the US after the war in 1848 and for what... Manifest Destiny. Furthermore our immigration policy is not the best and needs serious reforming. Y si quieres hablar mal de otros no se te olvide de donde viniste y cu√°les sacrificios tus ancestros ten√≠an que hacer. Soy Americana por nacimiento pero orgullosa de tener ra√≠ces Mexicanos y padres que son trabajadores que nunca han pedido nada a nadie.

There are a lot of people who don't like immigrants at all, and this was proved after the Presidential Election. These past months have put a lot of spot light on the ignorant, hypocrite, and racist remarks that many people love to make about immigrants. Many American citizens who have it all, complain about people migrating into the United States because they are doing it the illegal way, however, does it not cross through their mind that MAYBE it is not as simple as they think it is, to be accepted into the United States after requesting it? It's annoying because these are the same people who don't understand the reasons behind the actions of an immigrant. They will never be able to understand what immigrants are willing to do, and how much they are willing to risk, just to provide the best for their families and for themselves. Migrating from a person's home country, to a completely different one is not fun nor easy, but some people act as if immigrants do this just for the hell of it.

The US Govt. has broken EVERY treaty it ever made with the Natives. Those settlers created a government with skewed, racist immigration laws that favored white western europeans over everyone else. United States Naturalization Law of 1790 only applied to white people. the Chinese exclusion 1882. banned non-white and non-europeans from immigrating to the USA. The Immigration Act of 1924 prohibiting the immigration of East Asians and Asian Indians. (not to mention the time of the slave trade and current xenophobic practices) so yeah....no one came here "legally". anyone who brags about being here "legally" never mentions that it is only because a bunch of racist made it "legal" to be racist in immigration.

Thus, if the ban passes, they'll be illegal. Your argument for "good, law-abiding immigrants" is hollow when there are barriers being put up where at some point - their entry will be considered illegal. And that is why this video exists - to defend immigrants, whether they're legal or not.

First I'll combat your rational and then explain a better view point. Do you know that he deceleration of independence was illegal? They broke the law because the law was unjust, because the founding fathers knew that a country governed with just laws was better than one of tyranny. So when you see a law you know is unjust , the advice of a founding father would be to break it. secondly, all immigration is a net positive, even illegal. because these people need to eat, wear clothes and have somewhere to stay. which means they are supporting businesses. The money they spend is like an economical stimulus package, not to mention the number of industries that straight up depend on them, textiles and agriculture would grind to a standstill if they deported all illegal immigrants.

You do know you can only get welfare when you have a social security number and proof of being a U.S. citizen. There is not a single illegal immigrant on welfare, has any form of health insurance, or any rights. They can't take anything from the government.

So I ask you did they come to America because they wanted to or was it because they were in a country that had limited resources and hey wanted a better life for their family. Again I ask you if you're truly American no immigrant ancestors. There's no way. Because even the first Americans were immigrants from England that came to America and claimed it as there's. America wouldn't function without immigrants. A lot of America's population throughout history has been immigrants.

I&#39;m a centrist and loathe Donald Trump, but I&#39;m totally on board with him on this topic. God you guys are dishonest.<br />Among other things, ILLEGAL immigrants hurt the US by: <br /><br />-Sending a large percentage of their money out of the US, never to be spent here <br />-Depressing wages and disproportionately harming African Americans and young people <br />-Overcrowding already underfunded schools <br />-Lowering property values in neighborhoods where multiple people live in one home with no intention to put down roots<br />-Causing chaotic identity theft <br />-Waving non-American flags in a bid to gin up support for takeover of lands (see MECHA and Aztlan) <br />-Disproportianately carrying communicable diseases passed that were once quarantined and largely eliminated<br />-Overburdening social services that did not account for the influx of low wage earning people <br />-Closing hospitals that bow under insurmountable costs in servicing illegals who largely do not pay anything for those services. Costs passed on to the American citizen population<br />-Lack of wage tax due to under the table payment<br /><br />I could go on and on, but you don&#39;t really care since you apparently think we can&#39;t figure you out.

They just want to cut lines and feel justified because it's "their land". I don't need to tell you that though, as it's contained in this dishonest video very clearly for everyone to see. Here's just a few of lyrics I heard in Spanish where they hide most of the entitlement. Perhaps they didn't think this gringo could understand?, "I see your people and they don't work as hard as ours" "We'll fight you like the Sandinistas in Nicaragua" "I don't need an American passport because half of this gringoland is Mexico's" "We plant all the trees and they eat all our fruit" "We're the ones that cross over here so that we can come find all the gold you've stolen from us. teal back the gold you stole from us" As for it being too expensive, since they keep saying they're here to invade for üá≤üáΩ, why would they bother? Hell, I'd be feel fine if Mexico sent up their most skilled workers, but they don't.

He was a real human being, Who really did boost this country into the sky with this writting skills. The musical simply puts his story into a mainstream source where it can be absorbed. The phrase &quot;Immigrants, we get the job done&quot; Is because he and his french friend helped fight in the revolutionary war. Without them we may not even be America. If you dont like musicals thats ok. Dont listen to the sound track, dont read the overveiw. If you don&#39;t support the message, thats ok!!!!

They still are human beings and they still work hard and have families and maybe even left their families to come to America to earn more for them. Yes there are people that come with bad intentions but their are also American citizens that do crime. Both of my parents are immagrants, my dad from El Salvador and my mother from Brazil. At one point my mother was an illegal immagrant but now she is an American citizen and so is my dad now. My parents are the most hard working people I know and they worked veerryyy hard to give me the life I have now. They went from a dirty appartment building and living with rats to giving me a macbook air for school when I asked for it. So no illegal immagrants should not just be simply deported because they are illegal and the borders are secure and deportation should be used when its needed. I hope this doesn't brush you the wrong way but I just had to share this.	UCCo0nynXJHZmdIt-aZ5V7fg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCo0nynXJHZmdIt-aZ5V7fg	1	Ugh2SQC5luJ3h3gCoAEC	Kimber Weston

There are more law-abiding illegal immigrants than people want to admit; why aren't they being nationalized sooner? One of my college professors was an expat from England, and after living in the US for 23 years, he just became a US citizen and few months ago. If it can take that long for someone from one of our closest allied nations to become a US citizen, I can't imagine how long it would take for anyone else to become one.

All you have to do is look at how Sweden and Germany's crime and rape rate sky rocketed after they opened their boards to refugees without background checks. For every fifty good people you let in there is one bad one and those numbers of bad people start to add up after awhile.

(HINT: Federal law mandates that, and it's fixed to UNION wages). IF you see a road crew made up largely of illegal immigrants- the COMPANY is shorting their pay and pocketing the difference. But you have hit upon a MAJOR problem: employers who pay cheap rates (often below minimum wage) to immigrants. Saw it frequently in construction and some food processing plants. Those are the people we should be hammering on, not some guy from El Salvador trying to make an honest buck.

To see it as the same experience seems, to me at least, to be bit naive.

Society creates or discovers new social groups that are being oppressed all the time, and right now the hip new group that can claim oppression by Americans is immigrants.

Coming from immigrant parents, they were exploited for a while before they earned respect from their coworkers. When my father became a citizen, he was able to provide healthcare to my mother and older sisters. Soon, my mother became a permanent resident and my sisters became citzens as well. I only had the benefit of being born as a natural citizen. They worked from the ground up, from working at a Chinese restaurant to now working for an international manufacturer and a government-run hospital respectively. We pay yearly taxes, pay for bill, and everything in between. I'm just the decendant of two immigrant parents, and carrying on their name with pride, as a first-born in the United States.

What sickens me is how he said it was patriotic, and is even dumber when you realize one of the people defending the girl was a Marine. Listen, I'm sorry I sound like I'm saying every Muslim is either pro-Isis or IS Isis. I definitely know that they're good moderate muslims out there, heck one of my best friends is Muslim! But, I think it's bad as well too call every white man a mentally ill mass shooter, or were you doing that to put a spin of what I was trying to say, with white people instead... and, also, I don't like Donald Rump, Drumpf, whatever nickname you can come up with him, I think he an egotistical maniac who only wanted to become president just so he can be even more "memorable" in history. And I am also not a republican, nor a democratic, sounds dumb right? I like to pick the good ideas from both sides and call myself independent... again, sorry for sounding like an ass as well, hope we can talk it out ;).

But what im saying and what your ignoring is you cant paint all Muslims with the same brush as Isis, just like i cant say you (if you are white which i dont know) you are just like all the mass shooters in America. Im not saying terrorist attacks dont exist. But terror in America is more likely to come with a white face and a gun over a bomb and a brown one. And if we give all 'Lone" gunmen who are white the benefit of acting alone shouldn't be allow the same courtesy to Muslims? They dont all meet in some basement and plan how to murder, we cant knock the large majority for what a few lone wolves do. And in America, which is my country and so the only place i can speak for, we are more likely to get attacked by a shake or hit by lightening then attacked by a Muslim Terrorist. And we are much much more likely statistically to be shot by an armed white gunman then any other race religion or nationality. To be fair some of that is because we have more white people then any other demographic. But that doesnt change the facts. Sandy hook, the Charleston shooting, that Pizza gate guy, the one with the knife who killed those men defending those Muslim girls in Seattle, the one who shot up that baseball practice in DC. If you dont color all white people for their crimes you cant color all Muslims for the crimes of a few. If your an American you are face safer from one then the other.

I know they exist (Sandy Hook). But if we're going to talk about mass shootings like, what about what Muslims did in London shall we? The concert shooting, the London bridge shooting, even the one where a van drove into a mosque... that wasn't a Muslim caused one, you know what WAS a Muslim caused terrorist attack not too long ago? The truck attack (in Paris) killing 80 people. And about African American people being equally likely to kill people as any other race based on survival? 2 examples of VERY high murder rates caused by African Americans with gang violence and not self defense would be Detroit and Chicago...

Ugh-6mimwykndXgCoAEC.8UNAlFoV0BY8UOtP9OkUyI		1	2017-06-29 17:05:06	Noob Chic	Actually studies show that no one race commits crimes at a higher rate (except mass shootings those are committed more by white males) Over all people within the same socioeconomic background will commit the same crimes as its ingrained as a part of their survival. For instance, theres been studies that show blacks and whites consume pot at the same rates, but blacks are something like four times as likely to be arrested for it. So our judicial system isnt a good measure of who commits more crimes, only who is prosecuted for them more. And its no secret that its much easier to get off charges in this country if your white. That swimmer, in Cali i believe, raped a girl and got three months, she was left in a heap behind a dumpster and he was given leniency because "He had a future" those same thoughtful chances aren't given to minority children.

But i don't accuse all Christians of child molestation, though many of their religious leaders have been. A cardinal if i'm not mistaken was charged in Australia yesterday, maybe the day before as theres a time difference between there and here. But i will never say all Christians touch children, just like ill never say that about Muslims. In the bible it says its ok to have slaves, to beat your wife, to force her to have an abortion if she has an affair. You go to hell for eating pig and crab, for wearing mix blend clothes. We can compare ancient religions that make no sense all day. You cant judge all their believes with a single brush stroke though. As for Trump, he said Mexico (as if it was some government program) wasn't sending their best and brightest but sending murderers and rapist... thats not up for debate its on film. He lamented not being able to beat black people at one of his rallies "Like in the good ol days" He speaks out every time he thinks a brown person commits a crime, but when its someone with a pale complexion, like the man who shot up a mosque in Canada he was blissfully silent. He admitted to walking in on Miss Teen USA contestants... thats sounds pretty pervy, maybe not marrying a 9 year old but certainly leering at naked teen girls. Our race doesnt mean we cant be wrong, or racist. I saw a woman on the news who voted for trump and her husband was deported. I saw a man who voted for him and now worried Trump will steal his health insurance. Many vote against their own best interest. Its not proof in anything other then we as voters need to be better informed.	UCLCkdzTwEa7DjHCoCz6ymCw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLCkdzTwEa7DjHCoCz6ymCw	1	Ugh-6mimwykndXgCoAEC	Sandy Raven

And just because they voted for Obama doesn't excuse they also voted for trump. They might not be racist, in they wear white hoods and burn crosses on peoples laws. But they were ok with a man who admitted to sexual assault, who disparaged whole races and religions because for once White people in America feel as disenfranchised as the rest of us? Im Puerto Rican, being that my family hails from an American Colony my story is very different from others, but because im more privileged then Mexicans or Cubans or Blacks or South Americans or Asians in how we came to this country doesn't mean i can stand by why they are targeted and pushed down. Trump won because whites in America were more worried about themselves over the whole. I dont ever think a politician will just do better for me, they dont have that power. But i will always vote for and support those who want to do the greatest good for all my people. The man who bashes Muslims and grabs women, and pretends all Mexicans are criminals isnt that. Also please dont discount that trump didnt get more votes, so i have some faith that most in this country really dont want a bigot as president, they dont want America falling from grace on the world stage like we are now.

The bay of pigs invasion was us-trained cuban immigrants. other latin american immigrants didnt have a "scary communist" regime to run from. u feel me? it is different. also the fact that the first wave of cuban immigrants were mostly rich and white also helped, note the difference between the first gen of cuban immigrants (the ancestors of Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio) and the much poorer, much blacker immigrants that came in the 1980s . also also also wet foot/dry foot (although its over now) was a pretty big fucking difference. no other latin american nation had that same privilege of easy immigration. u feel me? no disrespect tho just tryin to vocalize	UCTsIBmW2AtE34caEW9o_3Mw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTsIBmW2AtE34caEW9o_3Mw	1	Ugh-6mimwykndXgCoAEC	Sandy Raven

The majority are trying to escape political/ economic turmoil and violence in their home countries, many of these problems caused by our own country&#39;s international policies. It takes years, even decades to get &quot;legal&quot; status in the USA. It&#39;s difficult to even get a tourist visa. These people don&#39;t have years to wait to do things the &quot;right way.&quot; They either stay and risk starvation, slavery, getting raped, getting murdered and kidnapped, or they can take the chance to cross the border. If I was a mother and had to choose between my children getting kidnapped and turned into child soliders or escaping with them, I would try to escape. I would do everything in my being to protect them. My family was lucky enough to have the social capital to go through the USA immigration process. Even then, it took my parents over 10 years to get their citizenship. But I&#39;m not upset with those who crossed the border because I understand that the majority of these people aren&#39;t as lucky as my family was. I encourage those of you that are against undocumented immigrants to take the time to sit down and listen to their stories. After all, they are human beings just like you and me, and we all have the right to live.	UCppoQJj5KFmr4iJbOA1__ig	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCppoQJj5KFmr4iJbOA1__ig	0

I hate to see people write horrible things about this when they haven&#39;t gone through all the things immigrants go through. Not knowing whether you&#39;ll live to get to the other side and be capable of fending foe your family. Before judging other people educate yourself and learn about what people have to go through just to get to a place that is crawling with racism. Learn and think about what you would do foe your family and how far you would go so your family could prosper.	UCum4IdkxojPusBjWg6zV6JQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCum4IdkxojPusBjWg6zV6JQ	0

All of these people talking about &quot; we don&#39;t like illegal immigrants&quot; need to have several seats . Because America is originally owned by the Natives. I don&#39;t see no one telling the whites ( which are the ones who took America that wasn&#39;t there&#39;s in the first place) to leave. Society would rather ignore the truth. Immigrants/ Minority do get the job done and will continue even though they are helping a country that doesn&#39;t respect what they do.

If you don't like it you're perfectly free to go back to listening to Toby Keith. 2) The line between legal immigrants, "illegal" immigrants and American citizens IS blurry. It's not so easy to deport people so critical to our economy with citizen children, many of whom have lived here longer than you and who may have been brought over as children through no fault of their own. 3) Our immigration system IS a giant clusterfuck that needs to be fixed. Walls and refugee bans are counterproductive political gestures, not solutions. 4) If criticizing racist nativism offends you, that's your problem. 5) It glorifies changing the law. You have a problem with the Right to Free Speech? 6) This video celebrates immigrants of all stripes. As with so many other topics this President doesn't understand (e.g., climate change, international relations, freedom of the press, etc.), immigration is not a zero sum game.

I will try to tell you my perspective of this. This video wasn't saying that natural born Americans and their ancestors haven't built this country. They've definitely contributed and so have immigrants. However immigrants are very underrated and most people don't know what they've done for this country. Of course some problems do sprout from immigration. But if you've noticed, immigrants are one of the most hardest working people in America. This doesn't mean you or your ancestors don't/haven't worked hard. It just means that your hard work has been recognized while the hard work of immigrants are rarely ever recognized. I understand your side of this. I just wanted to speak about what I think. Please take this into consideration and have a nice day ^_^	UCQKLT7ZWAReNmVttZoDbsAA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQKLT7ZWAReNmVttZoDbsAA	1	UgiwzGMoito6zXgCoAEC	THE MEMER

Arizona new mexico Utah later the US government would repay with their own land and large swaths of territories that were given to them eventually these were integrated into full states giving them even more rights flash forward to now we are still spending billions to the native american reparation fund TLDR they are not immigrant because they were not moving to a pre-existing country and native american land was taken by the US justly	UCA6iXofJklutmjCdzj0s6DA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCA6iXofJklutmjCdzj0s6DA	1	UgiwzGMoito6zXgCoAEC	THE MEMER

The exact same travel ban that Obama, Bush Jr. and Clinton enacted on their perspective watches. The only difference is when the 3 of them faced any issues in enacting theirs, they just said heck with it and let it go. This is not a Muslim ban!

This country is built on immigrants and anyone should be allowed to practice their religion in peace. I think what makes everyone so upset is how people feel like their government is turning a blind eye to possible security concerns that the everyday person has towards the influx of refugees and the US is somehow responsible for people's welfare in other countries. One of the things I do like about Trump is scaling back the military role as "world policemen" and that terrorrists do come from these countries listed on the travel ban list. That being said we fundamentally disagree on a lot more things...	UC5Q1iKKI_8iw_MqdUPANKOA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5Q1iKKI_8iw_MqdUPANKOA	1	UgjMFNFsZXEtH3gCoAEC	ViperKnight94

I am the great grand daughter of a disabled czech man fleeing a life of poverty with no job, no money, no english, at a time when eastern Europeans where thought to be lazy and dirty people, ruining the gene pool of this country. Now I hear these same sentiments thrown at the feet of todays immigrants. America continues to fall asleep. She forgets who she is.. those who built her.. the damage she has caused when she becomes ignorant of her true place in this world. This video hits home for so many. Watch, enjoy, share.. But more than anything, remember to learn the true stories of this nation and the people who live here.

Its simple economics, you want immigrants so bad? How about you pay for their taxes and you house them. Oh wait you probably wont, because you leftist are fine with thousands of illegal immigrants coming here , but when it comes down to the real shit, you guys expect the government to willingly get fucked. Nah man thats not the way the world works. Yes the world is fucked up , but guess what america isnt all flowers and sunshine. It bad enough we have to fix our broken country , we shouldnt have to fix other countries as well.

Farmers and immigrants weren't in need anymore because they were being replaced with skilled workers and machines. 1921, they set up the quota system to restrict legal immigration and the amount of immigrants coming in. These guys are spoiled now. You immigrants can come of America if you want, you just have to go through the procedures, there's no one stopping you from doing that. Just don't break the law and come here illegally and take up all our tax money, cause its our money we earned and got legally.

They risked everything, many had to leave their lives behind, and that wasn&#39;t an easy choice to make. My mother grew up in poverty, and was brought over in her teens. She still misses her home to this day. Only recently was she able to go back after becoming an American resident. People don&#39;t come here just because they can, people come here because it&#39;s the best choice they could make. I understand being here without papers is breaking the law, but I believe it makes more sense to help illegal immigrants become legal rather than kicking them out. We as a country have to start seeing illegal immigrants as people instead of pest. Be a little more open minded.	UCQf1gi65srlyjowo3Xy78VA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQf1gi65srlyjowo3Xy78VA	0

I don&#39;t think any level headed citizen wants people who genuinely come here for a better, more fruitful, life to be deported back to war zones and third world areas. The idea of immigration is the core of this nation&#39;s philosophy on governing. So the future plan has to generally be to provide a real, timely opportunity for illegal hard working people to become legal and live here. And at the same time, deport those who bring crime and violence. America is the land of opportunity. We cannot forget that.

Apart from the actual fact that undocumented immigrants pay billions in taxes every year (in the US) without gaining any benefits (unemployment, medicaid, food vouchers, retirement.) https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/09/undocumented-immigrants-and-taxes/499604/ (Gosh that article (complete with links to government sites) was so very hard to source!) Also, https://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2016/10/06/how-much-tax-do-americas-undocumented-immigrants-actually-pay-infographic/#3ac077a21de0 or the non-partisan Politifact's judgement on the Atlantic article and others: http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2016/oct/02/maria-teresa-kumar/how-much-do-undocumented-immigrants-pay-taxes/ In fact, the largest cost you could possibly attribute to undocumented immigrants (if you were being mean) is the cost of rounding them up and tossing them out of your country. And all those jobs they 'stole' from you? Well, I'm sure you'd be welcome to fill their below-minimum-wage, uninsured, back-breaking, dirty, endless jobs. Oh, you don't like getting your hands dirty? Guess you'd better rely on people you would otherwise shit on, and then blame for getting dirty. By the way, I'm so white, I just about glow. Predominantly Anglo-Celtic heritage (with a smattering of other European heritage.) I knew of two indigenous students in my entire time at school. So. Very. White.

It's obvious you know nothing about claiming exempt status, or for those who file with a stolen identity, will more likely then not get a refund of all that money. Speaking of ignorant, do you know how a progressive tax system works? Second, you do realize that sales tax is a state tax and is less then 10% or zero in most states, don't you?

How bout white collar work? Professional? How much do you think the average illegal alien pays in Federal taxes on the progressive tax schedule? Did you know that over 90% of illegals pay no tax or GET MORE federal tax back then they put in? See, this is where you're theory falls apart, because you seem to think that work means digging a ditch or swinging a hammer. Sorry to burst your bubble but they DO NOT do so much more than regular people. Add to that these Spanish lyrics I happen to understand (I'm a fluent gringo who picked up the language while laying around the house): "I see your people and they don't work as hard as ours" "We'll fight you like the Sandinistas in Nicaragua" "I don't need an American passport because half of this gringoland is Mexico's" "We plant all the trees and they eat all our fruit" "We're the ones that cross over here so that we can come find all the gold you've stolen from us. teal back the gold you stole from us" So what's this video about again?

We need to make the ability to become a LEGAL immigrant easier, because I don't like the fact that the US is in debt, and a lot of it is because illegal immigrants don't pay taxes. And trust me, I am not saying that all illegal immigrants don't want to pay taxes, and stay as illegal immigrants because they're comfortable not paying them. It's only fair that people come here. If you think about it, NO land on earth really belongs to anybody. We just made that up. It's all an illusion. My family (all of it, except for me) are immigrants. We're beyond blessed to be citizens, and there's nothing wrong with more people coming in here as long as they are LEGAL immigrants. Definitely, making being a legal immigrant easier would be MUCH better.	UC02xxdEeOjBPYsbl41imlFA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC02xxdEeOjBPYsbl41imlFA	1	UghJttSi9qqvMXgCoAEC	Blue Ape

We&#39;ve got the House and the Senate debating this issue, and it&#39;s... it&#39;s really astonishing that in a country founded by immigrants, &quot;immigrant&quot; has somehow become a bad word. So the debate rages on and we continue....<br /><br />[&quot;Yorktown&quot; sample]<br />[Hercules Mulligan]<br />And just like that it‚Äôs over, we tend to our wounded, we count our dead<br />[John Laurens]<br />Black and white soldiers wonder alike if this really means freedom‚Ä¶<br />[George Washington]<br />Not yet<br /><br />[Verse 1: K‚ÄôNaan]<br />I got 1 job, 2 job, 3 when I need them<br />I got 5 roommates in this one studio, but I never really see them<br />And we all came America trying to get a lap dance from Lady Freedom<br />But now Lady Liberty is acting like Hilary Banks with a pre-nup<br />Man, I was brave, sailing on graves<br />Don‚Äôt think I didn‚Äôt notice those tombstones disguised as waves<br />I‚Äôm no dummy, here is something funny, you can be an immigrant without risking your lives<br />Or crossing these borders with thrifty supplies<br />All you got to do is see the world with new eyes<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />Immigrants, we get the job done<br /><br />Look how far I come<br />Look how far I come<br />Look how far I come<br />We get the job done<br /><br />Look how far I come<br />Look how far I come<br />Look how far I come<br />Immigrants, we get the job done<br /><br />[Verse 2: Snow Tha Product]<br />It‚Äôs a hard line when you‚Äôre an import<br />Baby boy, it&#39;s hard times<br />When you ain&#39;t sent for<br />Racists feed the belly of the beast<br />With they pitchforks, rich chores<br />Done by the people that get ignored<br /><br /> <br />Ya se arm√≥<br />Ya se despertaron<br />It‚Äôs a whole awakening<br />La alarma ya son√≥ hace rato<br />Los que quieren buscan<br />Pero nos apodan como vagos<br />We are the same ones<br />Hustling on every level<br />Ten los datos<br />Walk a mile in our shoes<br />Abr√≥chense los zapatos <br />And it started<br />And they awoke<br /> <br /><br />The alarm went off a while ago<br />Those who want, search<br />But they label us hoodlums<br /><br /><br />Here‚Äôs the details<br /><br />Better buckle your shoes<br />I been scoping ya dudes, y&#39;all ain&#39;t been working like I do<br />I&#39;ll outwork you, it hurts you<br />You claim I‚Äôm stealing jobs though<br />Peter Piper claimed he picked them, he just underpaid Pablo<br />But there ain&#39;t a paper trail when you living in the shadows<br />We&#39;re America&#39;s ghost writers, the credit&#39;s only borrowed<br />It‚Äôs a matter of time before the checks all come<br />But‚Ä¶<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />Immigrants, we get the job done<br /><br />Look how far I come<br />Look how far I come<br />Look how far I come<br />We get the job done<br /><br />Look how far I come<br />Look how far I come<br />Look how far I come<br />Immigrants, we get the job‚Äî<br />Not yet<br /> <br /><br />[Bridge: Snow Tha Product]<br />The credit is only borrowed<br />It‚Äôs America&#39;s ghost writers, the credit&#39;s only borrowed<br />It‚Äôs America&#39;s ghost writers<br />America&#39;s ghost writers<br />America&#39;s ghost writers, the credit&#39;s only borrow-borrowed<br />It‚Äôs Americas ghost writers, a credit is only borrowed<br />It‚Äôs Americas ghost writers, a credit is only borrowed<br />It‚Äôs Americas ghost writers, a credit is only borrowed<br />It&#39;s<br /><br />[Hook]<br />Immigrants, we get the job done<br /><br />[Verse 3: Riz MC]<br />Ay yo aye, immigrants we don‚Äôt like that<br />Na they don‚Äôt play British empire strikes back<br />They beating us like 808‚Äôs and high hats<br />At our own game of invasion, but this ain&#39;t Iraq<br />Who these fugees what did they do for me<br />But contribute new dreams<br />Taxes and tools, swagger and food to eat<br />Cool, they flee war zones, but the problem ain&#39;t ours<br />Even if our bombs landed on them like the Mayflower<br />Buckingham Palace or Capitol Hill<br />Blood of my ancestors had that all built<br />It&#39;s the ink you print on your dollar bill, oil you spill<br />Thin red line on the flag you hoist when you kill<br />But still we just say &quot;look how far I come&quot;<br />Hindustan, Pakistan, to London<br />To a galaxy far from their ignorance<br />Cos-<br /><br />[Hook]<br />Immigrants, we get the job done<br /><br />[Verse 4: Residente]<br />Por tierra o por agua<br />Identidad falsa<br />Brincamos muros o flotamos en balsas<br />La peleamos como Sandino en Nicaragua<br />Somos como las plantas que crecen sin agua<br />Sin pasaporte americano<br />Porque La mitad de gringolandia Es terreno mexicano<br />Hay que ser bien hijo e puta<br />Nosotros Les Sembramos el √°rbol y ellos se comen la fruta<br />Somos los que cruzaron<br />Aqu√≠ vinimos a buscar el oro que nos robaron<br />Tenemos mas trucos que la polic√≠a secreta<br />Metimos la casa completa en una maleta<br />Con un pico, una pala<br />Y un rastrillo<br />Te construimos un castillo<br />Como es que dice el coro cabr√≥n?

Becoming a legal citizen isn&#39;t as easy as going to the post office and changing your address! There are people who immigrated to this country and have paid lots of money over the years to still not have their day in immigration court to become citizens! Also either they are stealing all the jobs or stealing all the welfare(can&#39;t get welfare in America if you are not a citizen) but it can&#39;t be both!

UgiAEHtaASF9b3gCoAEC	0	11	2017-06-28 23:28:02	Christopher beltran	all of you people that say immigrants are fine but the illegal ones should go dont understand anything 99% of field workers are illegals that are getting paid lower than minimum wage,100 degree weather, and 8 hours a day and they make up Americas economy. Here&#39;s why where they come from getting good paying jobs is fucking difficult so they come here knowing that they will probably end up in the fields but to them its a good paying job. they are illegal but will not break the laws expect coming here illegally because if they mess up and the police catches them they get deported and fail their family. so thats why they work their asses off in jobs that the whites dont want to work in but still complain that they take them. i guarantee that if you had a button that could deport all illegal immigrants in an instance, USA would fall and crash. yes they do come here illegally but they make up the economy. And all for what, to support their family.

They don&#39;t understand that immigrants built America, they shaped America to what America is today...and it all started with an immigrant. An immigrant that became an orphan at 12, that came to New York for an education, that was our first<br /> U.S. Treasury, Alexander Hamilton. He was the founder of, &quot;The New York Post,&quot; founded the first NATIONAL BANK, and founder of the Coast Guard, AS AN IMMIGRANT! At that time, immigrants were NEVER noticed. Hamilton shaped America! Only God knows what America would be today if it weren&#39;t for Alexander Hamilton, AND TO BE A FORGOTTEN FOUNDING FATHER! People don&#39;t understand, and yes, he had an affair with an other woman, yes, he was gay, yes, his son died of a duel 3 years before Hamilton and Hamilton and his wife had a hard time with the loss of their child. People sometimes look at the ten dollar and say, &quot;Who the heck is he?&quot; but people don&#39;t know his story, they don&#39;t know what he experienced. But thanks to Lin-Manuel Miranda, he TOLD Hamilton&#39;s story, THROUGH A MUSICAL!! That&#39;s a beautiful thing, God bless that and Hamilton.

Understand that they&#39;re not breaking the law because they&#39;re bad, they&#39;re doing it because there&#39;s not other option for them and they&#39;re risking their lives just looking for something better. Look at them and how they live, everything they have to deal with everyday and try to imagine what kind of life they used to have that they sacrificed so much to be like that.Yes, ilegal immigration is a problem ant it&#39;s not right, but they are people and they count as much as you do so stop blaming them and put yourself in their shoes. It&#39;s not about them, it&#39;s about the circumstances that made them immigrants, that&#39;s what needs to be fixed.

My grandpa had to stay behind because he had to continue making money for the rest of his family. My mom was stressed because she was only a teenager and was the only one in her family that could speak English. But they came to get a better life for my mom. Immigration is good when it's done legally. My mom and her parents had to work hard for their money, but they waited and got money. I have a friend who immigrated here from Argentina when she was just a baby. But she immigrated LEGALLY!!!! My teacher immigrated from Morocco. My other teacher immigrated from Turkey. The list goes on and on. But they all immigrated legally. IMMIGRATION IS GOOD WHEN DONE RIGHT. IT'S NOT FAIR FOR OTHER PEOPLE TO BE IMMIGRATING ILLEGALLY. IT POSES A THREAT FOR THE COUNTRY AS THERE IS NO DOCUMENTATION OF THEM, AND MAKES IT UNFAIR FOR THOSE IMMIGRATING LEGALLY.

People can be good as they can be bad, that applied for everyone no matter where they come from. Also, crime committed by those groups is very low, just look at the numbers published by the police (in fact, most of the crime is committed by white people and the difference is huge). You say they could come legally, but you don't know how hard it is, and as someone who came to the US legally i can tell you that for those who live in poverty (which is the most of them) it's impossible to get papers for a lot of reasons you wouldn't understand because you haven't deal with them or because you don't know about them, but to be legal you need a lot of resources and they don't have them. About jobs, it's true that they take those who anyone would want because they are desperate. They work without a social too, not because they asked you for yours means they won't hire someone who doesn't have one. People without documents get hire too, and get pay much less because they can't claim for more, and not only that they suffer abuse from their employers a lot of time because of the same reason. I think there's not reason to call anyone a "bitch" or use other kind of offenses against anyone here regardless of their opinion, and it's horrible to wish something terrible to happen to someone. This immigration issue is being handle wrong. The solution is not being xenophobic, treating people like they were garbage or building a wall, any of this is going to solve anything. You can't let them in as they want because you can't support everyone and as I say that's a problem, but problems need to be solve from the roots and if the problem is in another country well it's your problem too because it affects you, and everything affecting you is your problem.

And don't forget that there are still some that commit crime, I'm not saying ALL, but I am saying some. A 20-something boy in Texas was shot while driving home by an illegal immigrant that was initiating in a gang. He had a family who loved him, but he's gone now because of our shitty border control. And on top of that, we send the criminal illegal immigrants back to their home country only for them to escape their prisons to come back over the border and commit more crime. The man who shot the boy had previously been detained and should have been serving time in prison but instead was sent back to Mexico to serve time there, where he ended up escaping and going right back over the border to eventually end up killing the boy. Is it fair that we legal citizens have to live with that risk? Illegal immigration is a massive issue, and Trump is the only one trying to fix it right now. He should give current illegal immigrants a chance to earn their citizenship, but some should be deported depending on their backgrounds. They should only be granted citizenship because it's unfair that our government has allowed them to come over without repercussions.

Some are good, some are bad. That's why there's a process to vet them. It needs reform to make the process go much faster, yeah, every smart person agrees, but that's all government institutions. They suck. The answer isn't to flood this country with all immigrants that want to come. As you say, every immigrant is coming here for a reason. But the country has 300 million people already and plenty of them don't have jobs. How can you make 100 million more blue collar jobs ? You obviously can't. You need to be smart and figure it out. It's a problem that needs thinking and exchange of ideas. Not throwing up our hands.

Which is why Reagan gave these folks amnesty in 1986. Everybody in the U.S. knows and has always known that a certain set of companies (produce growers, packing plants, and so forth) use illegal immigrants as their primary labor force--in order to pay lower wages and skirt labor laws. Republicans have always supported this because they thought it was more free market, and because the factory owners, growers, and other companies doing the hiring are big Republican donors. If one wants to stop this, then punish the cause, the companies hiring and recruiting these folks to come up here, instead of using the illegal immigration issue as an excuse to insult and attack people who look or sound different. Because as long as a packing plant is looking to fill up it's floor with underpaid and overworked undocumented immigrants, there will always be poor but hard-working and ambitious people willing to risk deportation if it means they might be able to give themselves and their families a better life. And to take a step back, illegally entering a country is hardly murder. Yeah, it is breaking the law, but so is underage drinking and driving over the speed limit (and these things are just done to have fun). Moreover, immigrants are significantly more law-abiding than the average American (https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/us/trump-illegal-immigrants-crime.html).

Excepting everyone who wants to come won't work there aren't enough jobs and people don't want to forfeit their money to pay to allow others to live in the country. On top of this because these immigrants would be poor they would have poor families and establish poor communities where crime rate would then increase. I sympathize with these people's struggles but there's no way currently for us to accept all of them without damaging our country.

Getting a visa, green card, passport, etc is not an easy thing to get in many countries, I know cause my family in India was once denied from a visa 3 times in a row. Its the law, it's been the law for a long time, it's used because it helps keep the US safe and secure from possible threats. Taking chances just because someone's life isn't good in their country is a big risk, which not many people understand. Don't get me wrong, I understand you completely, but at the end of the day it's not about what's right, but about what's safe because it's not about just 1 immigrant family.

You acknowledge it's bad, and it doesn't matter why they came over here. It's illegal. I know it doesn't mean they're bad people, but it's illegal. I think work for immigrants should be easier to get legally, I think that is the answer. And there should be a system that is put into place that makes sure that these are legitimate jobs and that these folks are actually working, basically making sure the job exists off paper. If we could do that and sew into it a path to citizenship, then tensions and economic health would probably change for the better.

I mean, the dollar has more value than many other currencies. The job opportunities in this country are better and more accessible than in other countries. The overall life style in United States is better than in other countries. Now, lets not forget that United States is also one of the strongest countries in the world because of foreigners. They might not come as immigrants, but, as professionals. Why do you think people come to United States to either work or study? Because it has more value. an associate degree from United States has more value than an associate degree in other countries. As for proffesionals, they come to United States to either expand their skills, or use the skills they learned in their countries and apply it here. either way, the ability to learn and apply the skills and knowledge of a professional is more flexible in United States than in other countries. So, yes, immigration it self is a big issue, but it won't stop until United States stops being a world leading country with, maybe not stable, but better economy than other countries.

You are more likely to be a criminal in the US if you are a white native-born citizen that is a fact. If you kick out all the illegal immigrants no one will do the low paying hard labor jobs they do. There are countless of stories about farmers who fire all the illegals and hire American works, who don't show up or quit soon after because the work is too hard. Because working on a farm or in a kitchen or as a janitor is not fun or easy but these people do it because they have to. In Central and South America violence is extremely high with gangs forcing young kids to join or die so many parents decide to leave. They want to come legally but the process to come as a refugee is extremely long and expensive taking more than a decade at times. They don't have time to wait their life is at risk so they do the only thing they can leave. They are the backbone of many communities because they do the work no one else wants. And many do pay taxes that is the only way they get many public benefits and those born here to illegal immigrants have as much the right to welfare as you or me. Trump wants to make the refugee process harder but anyone coming with the sole purpose of harming the US will not come as a refugee. It took my family 12 years to come from Cuba with my grandparents already in the states making it easier and that was in the 90s. It became much harder after 9/11 and as time has progressed. You can't act like people in other countries don't have the right to seek a better future for their kids. It is important to have law and order but it is more important to have compassion for people who don't have the same privilege as us. I am from a country that has an easier time coming to the US that's why I am here but most refugees never get the opportunity because most are denied entry. What would you do if your family was at risk? They have war and famine and violence their only option is the US no matter the way.

Legal immigrants have money and wealth, or they have US relatives who help pay for and sponsor their immigration. Poor immigrants with no one living in the US already don't . This "escape the police" BS is yet more uninformed ignorance. Most immigrants come here for a better life and a chance to give their kids the country they never had.

It's only those "illegals" who are working two and three jobs at a time that American citizens don't want to do "because it's hard" to feed their families who seem to be doing more to support a society that craps on them because of their point of origin than the hateful folks who live in it who have forgotten it's a nation built on the backs of undocumented workers. Also why we have idiot marijuana laws in the US, because they were tools used to attack and imprison Mexicans came to the US for a better life. (But we can't talk about that white man's agenda to criminalize and repress native brown people and foreign brown people alike.)

We didn't have the same mindset back then, we were explorers and colonizers. We landed there and all we saw was aggressive tribes scattered across the landmass. There was NO country established, no laws, nothing. You're just thinking this way because that's the modern way of thinking. Back then, it was completely normal for europeans.. and look at the US now. The most powerful country on earth thanks to the colonization.

They stole land, rape the indigenous women, destroyed homes and villages. And yet Native Americans were called the "savages". Yes, they did some weird stuff too, but it was their religion and culture and you should respect that. So maybe you should learn the basic facts...

OMG, I totally want mass immigration of nonwhites to displace white americans within the country they founded and built because imply they totally "deserve" replacement and displacement because the conquered Indian tribes they had wars. All those white settlers taking over and infiltrating all those Indian institutions, infrastructure, and getting al those Indian provided welfare/resettlements/affirmative action programs and GIBZMEDATZ for merely chowing up on the shore of the american contingent circa 1600-1750 as indentured servants to lay around and live off those native americans were the worse. Bring on the Rapegees Globalists, we need more of those because some Leftist pointed out some raping possible happened to Indians several centuries ago during wars or battles which of course implies white people deserve to be displaced and raped now!! OMG LEFTISTS totally right!!! It's truly racists to want to protect or look out for your own people and their lands/ property they created and built unless you are nonwhite of course.

The whites came and raped and pillaged Native American tribes, the only time Native Americans really fought back was when it was in defense (and sometimes retaliation). In fact, many white people were saved during the harsh months of winter and shit (think Plymouth) by Native Americans when they didn't know the land and how to get food. Sure they had wars where they killed each other, but so did whites, just in a more "sophisticated way". Europeans killed their own by starving their poor, by forcing and killing those who didn't believe in the God as the reigning church of the time did. (Also hey let's¬†not forget about the other truly savage things white Europeans did, cough cough, did we forget about the French Revolution?) It was the Natives' land, just as much as now this is American land. We to this day kill our people and have control over their bodies, but the land is still ours, no one is going to come claim America. The Natives got their land stolen because they weren't protected, and the Europeans took advantage of that. Lmao, I bet you think the civil war was about economics too right?

They had laws, and they had their own military. Because no matter how much white folks wanna try to spin it, the native tribal councils WERE AND ARE a form of government. Then again, when the Europeans decimated Mexico and the islands of the Caribbean, the same lie was told. Apparently the Aztec Empire wasn't a "government", apparently.

Then they went to Africa and decided to kick those people out and send them into slavery. Fucking white people dont even know that they COME FROM FUCKING CAVES. LITERALLY CAVES. AMERICAN LITERALLY SHOULD MEAN IMMIGRANT. Because NO ONE. AND I MEAN NO ONE. IS COMPLETELY JUST ONE FUCKING THING. FOR ALL WE KNOW DONALD TRUMP COULD BE FUCKING MEXICAN OR DUTCH OR SWEDISH OR BLACK. The point I&#39;m trying to make is, this country was founded by immigrants who didn&#39;t want to be known as fucking immigrants and created their own goddamn country. But hey, honestly if it wasn&#39;t for them being greedy bastards I wouldn&#39;t have half the opportunities I do know. And FYI I&#39;m mixed. My great grandparents were immigrants now that I think about it. THEY WERE FROM IRELAND üò≠. Jesus this post had gone so many places. Anyway this country was founded by immigrants. And everyone born in America is a fucking immigrant because that&#39;s basically what an American is. Everyone that moves here is a fucking immigrant. If they do it illegally then OH FUCKING WELL. THEYRE OUT THERE DIGGING UP OIL AND SHIT AND TRUST AND BELIVE THATS SOME SHIT I COULD NEVER DO. ESPECIALLY TO GET PAYED LESS THAN MINIMUM WAGE.

The fuck outta here, next time you'll be calling an american that spoke spanish illegal. Immigrants, illegal or not, work harder than Americans, yet they are paid less. The American dream, ah.. you americans take liberty for granted. Liberty is all we want. With that, we could live our type of American dream. We flee our corrupt countries to live in a place that offers everything our country does not, but instead we are faced with people who don't like us because of the way we came here. Don't get me wrong, I'm a US citizen, but I'm child of a parent who came here illegally just so that I could get a decent education.

Only the rich get opportunities in our countries and they're not thinking of fixing the system anytime soon because it benefits the ones on top. So people do what's naturally a human instinct, look for survival. Immigration has happened even in the middle ages and bc and ac eras. (The Celts had theirs taken by the Greeks, the Romans had theirs taken by the Arabs, etc, the Spanish took the land from the natives ) This is nothing new, people have taken each other's lands in hopes of survival for as long as there has been land so why does it matter now? Americans even took the land from native Americans and used the resources. Please don't be so close minded. For people that have migrated in the past and those who are doing it in the present, the only thing that matters is survival. You would do the same if you where in a similar situation trust me.

Most immigrants didn't finish high school or elementary because their parents made them work. It's an ugly cycle, unlike in the US, there's no easy way to climb the ladder to middle class. You're either lucky to be born to a rich family (fun fact, the richest man on earth is Mexican ) or have to help your parents who get 3-5 dollars a day, with you getting less than that because you're a minor. and because they couldn't pay for your education (school isn't free).-. Like I said before, everything's just a cycle. They don't give a visa to unedicated people. Court your blessings if you're from a first world country like the US.

Most of the people who rant and rail against undocumented immigrants have no idea at all of what it takes to move to the US. Nor how much it costs, because it's not a cheap "Hey, here's a test to show you understand the country and it's history" followed by a swearing in. US Immigration is easy if you have money or connections already in the US. If you're a poor kid from Central America or a non-European country with no one willing to sponsor you in the US... You're out of luck.	UCKUxr6UD8M8PXwmbg7PnmCg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKUxr6UD8M8PXwmbg7PnmCg	1	UggX3XFn7Fi2cXgCoAEC	lilcholesterol

The issue they have isn&#39;t about immigration, it&#39;s about illegal immigration. Notice, if you&#39;re a immigrant getting the job done, and you&#39;re documented, you will get to stay. But if you&#39;re a immigrant who is leeching, there should be an immigrant who would contribute, and that&#39;s why we deport.

The native Americans had not even invented the wheel, and the Europeans were transversing oceans. The native Americans did not have a set government or set of official laws about immigration or practically anything else. Do not compare today's illegal immigrants with the vastly superior European immigrants that cultivated the land and created modern civilization.

They try to conquer an area and if the people in that area can defend it, then they don't get their land stolen. But now there are laws and sovereign nations, so you can't take over an area like you could back then.

Nobody(that matters) wants to stop immigration just need them to be legal and accountable. It&#39;s really that simple just do it the right way, it is not a right but a privilege to be an American citizen. They need to come up with a way to fast track citizenship. Military service is a good option 4 years then citizenship. Don&#39;t like to here that you do things that we as Americans won&#39;t do. I have served in the military and carried concrete pieces covered in .pig shit 12 hours a day and because of the hard work am living a comfortable life today.

However, with that being said the U.S was involved in political, social, and environmental situations that they used for their own advantage which effected many countries negatively. The only reason I say this is because immigrants are being disrespected and many ignorant people say go back to where you came from. It's easy to say that when you only see one side of the story. Many don't fully understand why immigrants come in the first place . I respect the U.S, but also the past affects the present and the future. Hopefully people stop the hate and learn to help one another instead of tearing each other down. I recommend anyone that is interested in learning about the history of Latino immigration in the U.S to read Harvest of the Empire by Juan Gonzalez, fantastic book!

There were the Irish who were slaves, then were looked down upon by other white people. Remember jack from titanic, Irish.

I get that everyone is entitled to their own opinion but why even say something if it's insulting in the first place. I myself am a very opinionated person but even I would never go so far as to going in the comments in a video and calling the fandom "gay" as if it's a bad thing. I don't usually comment on other people who are being negative. I don't know why I made the decision to comment on this particular one but I did.

I hate assuming but you either learned this behavior from your parents. Or you were taught to not hide behind a screen and insult people or ideas. Either way I am sure that if you showed this comment to your parents or guardian they wouldn't be happy. This play isn't gay it's a piece of history that was turned into a masterpiece and something that brought people together. Stop using gay as an insult, even if you don't like gay people.

My parents were illegal immigrants and they have done nothing wrong for the past 20 years they've been in America. The thing that sucks was that during those 20 years, we have spent over $50,000 fighting to get citizenship for them. They're both citizens now, but the process takes too long and costs way to much money. We as a society need to address problem that affect everyone, not just the left or right	UC4I7WqR9iLCUn8oKbHooRWQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4I7WqR9iLCUn8oKbHooRWQ	1	UgjfW2EKUy6Ev3gCoAEC	Callum M

We&#39;ve got the House and the Senate debating this issue, and it&#39;s... it&#39;s really astonishing that in a country founded by immigrants, &quot;immigrant&quot; has somehow become a bad word.

I understand that they're most likely fleeing a 3rd world shit hole, and that they want a better future for their children. But also keep in mind that these people come already disrespecting the laws of the land, and also keep in mind the American taxpayer who have to pay for these people's expenses when they contribute almost nothing to the system. Finally keep in mind that there are plenty of immigrants who also want to get here LEGALLY, but whose patience is undermined because someone just skipped ahead to the front of the line.

If people want to come to this country, then maybe we should let them. If they're bad people, then we should check them out. But the majority of people outside of America that wan't to come in don't want to harm the country. If you really think that the few who do mean harm should outweigh all the people who just want to build a better lives for themselves and their families? America is a nation of immigrants, every single white American, at some point in their family tree, immigrated to the United States. If you really think that the illegal part of illegal immigrants is the problem, maybe you should advocate for immigration reform that makes it easier to enter the country. If you think the immigrant part is wrong, then not only are you being slightly hypocritical but you are also being xenophobic. Just try to imagine why illegal immigrants do what they do without immediately assuming they are trying to take down the American government. I know you must paranoid of a takeover by non-white people but you really need to look at history. White people have taken over vastly more countries and regions inhabited by non-whites than the other way around.

When people say shit like &quot;immigrants contribute to our society&quot; it shows that you are either being ignorant to push a political point, or that you arent aware politically and don&#39;t do research. Yea, legal immigrants contribute to our society...But Trump has never once said anything remotely close to being hostile to legal immigration, he&#39;s actually said the opposite dozens of times.The differences between illegal and legal immigration are very clear and self explanatory. This shit has to stop.	UCHWTuP6uqOV82h8H8VxGXMA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHWTuP6uqOV82h8H8VxGXMA	0

Please go back across the border so we can move in a few more folks who actually want to be here, and actually understand they're part of a society, not an elitist cult. (Also, you prove you know NOTHING about the US immigration program, when you spew trash like this acting like it's a simple process. It's not, and you'd probably be deported because you can't pass the test immigrants have to pass on their path to citizenship. Yet they work harder for a country that you don't give a crap about.)

What they fail to show are the fact that these are illegals, they broke the laws entering this country illegally; that a large constituents are gang/drug members, they drain our welfare, they depress our wages, they live in segregation and never assimilate to the culture or language of the country they invade, and they add to the pollution index (overpopulation = more pollution). <br />These performers will live in the comfort of their gated community in their rich establishments and won&#39;t see what the middle class has to deal with. Riz Ahmed will hang out with upper echelon &quot;white&quot; folks and attending the MET Gala, yet at the same time, make videos to talk shit about white people. And now, these idiots want to capitalize on current affairs when they really don&#39;t know the reality of the current situation.<br />What these idiots are suggesting that everyone should vacate their countries and just head to Europe and North America and that we should welcome them all freely. They will use the narrative that America was founded by immigrants, but fail to realize that America was a pretty empty country during those times and we needed to let people in who worked hard to develop it&#39;s laws and infrastructure. These idiots keep pushing that agenda. And then they moan and bitch about why we can&#39;t have universal healthcare. How exactly are we supposed to pay for everyone, including people who aren&#39;t even LEGAL???? How is it fair to the other immigrants who had to pay and wait in line to obtain rightful and lawful immigration status?<br />Liberal celebrities just don&#39;t get it. They rallied behind Hillary but that did not matter. The middle class does not care for the opinions of celebrities. And by the way, I am a democrat.

Since I moved here from Ireland at the age of 8 I have always been running small businesses or working jobs most I know wouldn&#39;t think of doing and making my own money. I pay for my own private school, I bought my own car, and have helped my parents pay the mortgage more than a few times. Now I&#39;m off to college on scholarship and paying my whole way through it!

And no one is hating on those people, just come in following the laws set forth by the Government. It&#39;s really that simple. And it&#39;s silly to think that because you are an immigrant that you are somehow a harder working individual than someone else. That in and of itself is ignorant to everyone around you, and rather self-centered.	UCTUAIYKM7O-tBRqwl3uFKPg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTUAIYKM7O-tBRqwl3uFKPg	0

We fight, like Sandino in Nicaragua, We are like plants that grow without water. Without American passport, Because half of gringolandia is Mexican land. You have to be good son of a bitch, We sow the tree and they eat the fruit. We are the ones who crossed, Here we came to find the gold they stole from us, We have more tricks than the secret police, We put the whole house in a suitcase. With a beak, a shovel and a rake, We built a castle for you.

Like seriously, did any of you even watch it without instantly thinking, &quot;OMG THIS IS AWESOME&quot; just because it was Hamilton related? <br /> This is everyday problems guys. Not just a video, I get it that it&#39;s for &#39;entertainment&#39;, but open your eyes.<br /> (And no, I won&#39;t be answering comments unless I deem necessary, so go away triggered ppl.)

Thank you. ;) ) That's what everyone either think or says. Have you ever listened to a song and actually payed attention to the lyrics? Almost every song is about feelings, be it rap, pop, rock, country, it's all there. Songs are an art (I'm glad you took note of that! üòä ), that expresses one feelings and really shows what the person is thinking or trying to highlight in ones life, job, mentality, personality, love life, and/or todays real world problems. This song (Obviously) points out real world problems. I very much understand that it's sometimes for entertainment, but in this case, I say not. But than again, it's only my opinion in the end right? Thank you for making an actual conversation and not yelling and cursing like others!	UCjnigN7orDXSD-8GQ5z5OXw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjnigN7orDXSD-8GQ5z5OXw	1	UggSplNkMsN1gHgCoAEC	Ollie Bear

I'm excited to hear another remix of a song I love so much, but I'm also equally excited to see the Hamilton team use their platform to shed light on the important topic. You don't have to underestimate anyone because they choose not to comment about these political topics because I'm pretty sure if all these comments were just people disagreeing over immigration policies, the art would be neglected. It's good to break it up sometimes and really just focus on the music.	UCRY-0U3DHO3WNspLdV7WpdA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRY-0U3DHO3WNspLdV7WpdA	1	UggSplNkMsN1gHgCoAEC	Ollie Bear

You keep talking about how they let in rapist and drug smugglers but that also goes for Americans. There are rapist in every culture and yet if there is the possibility that instead of rapist it's actually just a family without a home and support, you'd still turn them away? Also I bet you have no fucking idea about the long and misleading path of trying to become a citizen. There are cases where it takes up to thirty years to get accepted and some aren't even accepted at all. But it's fine you can hate immigrants but it is very likely in you future that someone in your family will marry and immigrant and you'll be able to do nothing about it.

We aren&#39;t considered immigrants but technically we all are so I don&#39;t understand why I&#39;ll all these people are getting treated so badly for being just like us. No one is purely from one country. Everyone comes from somewhere, they shouldn&#39;t be treated wrong because were all equal. This make me so sad.

This shows I know what I want my future to be. If this isn&#39;t fixes by the time I&#39;m old enough to become a presidential helper or even president, this will be one of my priories, equality will never existed if we don&#39;t make it fixed by being contrive. Government is not going to take charge of this we should of fixed this our selfs along time ago. Why?

The government should work for its citizens and not foreign citizens. Of course, you could come legally, but I guess that's too hard for you lazy illegals asses. All it takes is hard work to be a legal citizen. Imagine spending so much time and effort to be legal only to see some people get in across the border illegally now ruining the country that you belong to.

Our ancestors came here for new hope and other greedy filth for gold and fame. There are good and bad, the fact that people say "get out my country" here in America to illegal immigrants need to shut up, learn to be empathetic and shut up if you can't do anything about it. Most illegal immigrants come here because they don't have a choice, in their countries where gangs are after the, for no reason, government and president probably shitty. Most don't have a way to come here legally and do it illegally because the want to escape out of fear and hope. How about educate yourself on what's happening in other countries, why most illegal immigrants come here. Why other countries are so bad. I rather live in the United States full of ignorant racist assholes and immigration after my ass instead of my own country where there is also full of horrible people but my chances in the United States of living as a free person is higher than over there	UCTelaJROxQilsu5NobF9KEQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTelaJROxQilsu5NobF9KEQ	1	UghtdA9Gggib7HgCoAEC	Kayla A

No, the French Indian war wasn't fought while he was Pres. He was a surveyor, he knew where the good land was and he enriched himself when the Brits kicked the French's ass. He today would be the richest president in today's dollars, he also married into money, he married a woman he didn't love, he married for money. The war started in May 1754 where a party of British troops and Mingo warriors under 22 year old George Washington ambushed a patrol of 35 French Canadian soldiers in what is now modern day Pittsburgh. All French were either killed or taken prisoners. There's more Google it.	UC8q-XqNNyxpT2qxQjry9XgQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8q-XqNNyxpT2qxQjry9XgQ	1	UghtdA9Gggib7HgCoAEC	Kayla A

Lin-Manuel Miranda is basically doing what Shakespeare did back in the day, he's making something that both the lower class and higher class is enjoying, loving and talking about non stop. Which means that what Lin-Manuel Miranda is making goes beyond class. It's not about where you're from and what your lifestyle is, it's about the story, the characters and the music :)	UCDyNSTDh2os2UbUASPaHvWw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDyNSTDh2os2UbUASPaHvWw	1	UggzPPUCjFB08XgCoAEC	BobbyShyne

Kendrick is making true art for sure, but Lin-Manuel is forcing hip-hop to evolve. And I think Hamilton will stand the test of time while Kendrick's work will sound like it was made when it was made, you know what I mean Joshua? Storytelling has always been a part of hip-hop, right? But with In The Heights and Hamilton, Lin-Manuel takes storytelling within rap to a whole different level, in my opinion.

When we live in a country founded by immigrants on the idea that everyone has the right to 'life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness', everyone should have a right to be proud of who they are. Also, as a brief side note, the most dangerous cancers are the malignant ones. Take from that what you will.
